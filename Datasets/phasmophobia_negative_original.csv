I feel like this is one of those Steam games everyone owns, but if you can help it, I wouldn’t get it. When you break it down, so much of Phasmophobia is just spent waiting and when not waiting, walking around slowly from point A to B. The only good qualities about this game is that it’s multiplayer with proximity chat which is a fun combination and that deciphering the ghost type can be fun in a detective kind of way. \n\nThat’s really about it though, the game doesn’t even have good presentation going for it. I mean it looks okay, I guess, but it’s just so stiff and amateurish, it’s the absolute bare minimum is my point. Overall, it’s an okay game, I guess. It’s fun enough, but only because multiplayer games, especially ones that have proximity chat, are just inherently fun in my opinion. Yeah, not great, basically any other multiplayer game would be more fun.","1736731108","1736731108","False","0","0","0.476190477609634399","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

I've played it with two different groups, both of which had wikis open on their 2nd monitors and were just speedrunning missions. I pretty much just sat there while they figured everything out in about 5 minutes. But the game is also basically impossible to play by yourself. So unless you find 3 other people to play with who also don't know how to play and you ONLY play it with them and they ONLY play it with you so that everyone is learning the game at the exact same pace. I want to say this isn't a design issue, but it... kinda is.\r\nPart of what makes the idea of ghost hunting fun is the element of the unknown and this game just... doesn't really have that anymore. I know that can also just be blamed on the internet and its insatiable need to dissect literally everything under the sun until literally nothing is a mystery anymore. But I feel like there are a few different ways they could remedy this. Requiring more than 3 pieces of evidence to determine a ghost type would be a good start. It would also be nice if pieces of evidence were less conclusive or consistent. Or, something I legitimately can't believe isn't already in the game: Objectives besides identifying and banishing the ghost. Finding a way to communicate with the ghost to get information would be so cool, whether that's figuring out how they died, who killed them, or literally anything along those lines.\r\nLiterally anything to make the game more complex than 1. Find ghost room. 2. Throw EVERY piece of equipment you have into ghost room. 3. Level complete.\r\nThe one way I was able to have fun in this game was by having my more experienced friends sit in a discord call and walk me through what to do. Unfortunately I also have to play the game with no audio because the low bass tone that plays the entire time you're in the house actively makes me feel sick.","1735990131","1735990131","False","0","0","0","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

You cannot filter or select teams to join based on level and as a new player you will be kicked again and again and again from lobbies because your level is too low and people don't want a 'noob' on their team. \r\n\r\nKicking players is a single click so you will be kicked without warning almost instantly. Once kicked you have to go through a 30s-1min process of rejoining multiplayer and finding the next lobby which will also likely kick you. It is very frustrating and creates a toxic experience. The host of a multiplayer game also cannot switch their hosted game from public to private, cannot directly invite their friends, and cannot reserve a spot for friends. The only way to hold a space for a friend is to keep kicking any player that joins until their friend does.\r\n\r\nThe player base is also unusually toxic and elitist. Because the game was in early access for so long there are a lot of players with years of experience, and a lot of higher level players are intolerant of new players and any mistakes (regardless of your level) are met with an instant kick.\r\n\r\nGriefing is also pretty common - people create game lobbies and never start a game just wasting your time, and there are a lot of ways trolls can join a game and grief the team by hiding items or activating cursed items and killing their team.\r\n\r\nReddit and Discord are full of these same complaints day after day but the Devs have not addressed the issues despite years of complaints.\r\n\r\nI absolutely would not recommend this game to anyone that is not already part of a friend group that plays. Trying to find multiplayer teams is just too toxic and too much hassle and is simply not worth it and single player mode is too hard at higher difficulties by yourself.","1735519225","1735519225","False","0","0","0.476190477609634399","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

This game is a dumpster fire, and if you’re considering buying it, just don’t. The amount of money this game has made since 2020 is absolutely insane, especially when you realize it’s still as broken and unfinished as it was on launch day. If you’ve got $20 to burn, throw it in the trash—it’s about the same experience.\n\nFirst, the ghost AI is a joke. Half the time, the ghosts are more like clumsy NPCs from a 90s horror game than the terrifying entities they’re supposed to be. One minute they’re hunting you, and the next they’re stuck behind a door or walking in circles like they’ve never seen a human before. There’s no tension. No real fear. Just a lot of waiting for a ghost to either teleport on top of you for no reason or wander aimlessly like it’s lost in the afterlife.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the voice recognition system. What a joke that is. The game acts like you’re supposed to be able to communicate with the ghost, but good luck getting it to even understand you. I’ve tried yelling, speaking slowly, and using different microphones, but the game either completely ignores me or somehow picks up half of what I said and misinterprets it like it was designed by a drunk toddler. Honestly, if I wanted to scream at something and get nothing back, I’d just yell at a wall.\n\nBut the worst part? The multiplayer. If you thought matchmaking was bad, you’re in for a treat. You’ll get kicked out of every single lobby. I’m not kidding. Every. Single. One. It’s not even about your connection—just the game’s absurdly broken mechanics. And once you finally get in a match, you’re stuck with trolls, cheaters, and people who are too busy throwing everything in the van or breaking the game just to mess with you. I’ve played with kids who think it’s funny to ruin everyone’s game, and guess what? The devs couldn’t care less. There’s no way to report them, no way to get rid of them. They’ve made millions and clearly don’t give a damn.\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on the grind. If you want to unlock all the upgrades needed to tackle the higher difficulties, you have to hit level 90. And let me tell you, that’s not something you’re going to achieve easily. You’re stuck doing the same repetitive tasks over and over again, grinding your way to that level, and by the time you get there, you’ll probably be so sick of the game that you won’t even care about the upgrades anymore. The grind is soul-crushing, and honestly, it’s just padding for a game that’s already lacking in content.\n\nLet’s talk content. Spoiler alert: it’s the same damn thing every time. The maps are repetitive, the ghosts are forgettable, and the objectives feel like busy work. After a few rounds, you’ve seen it all. You’re just mindlessly grinding, and the worst part? It’s been this way since launch. The game hasn’t meaningfully evolved at all since 2020. All that money? Gone. To whatever, because it definitely didn’t go into fixing or expanding the game.\n\nGraphics? Don’t even bother. This game looks like it was made in 2005, and it plays like it, too. The frame rate is garbage, it crashes for no reason, and the optimization is beyond terrible. This game can barely run on a decent machine, and somehow it’s still getting praise. If it wasn’t for the spooky “ghosts” walking around, you’d think you were playing a game from a decade ago.\n\nAnd the devs? They’ve taken the money and run. There’s barely any updates, and when they do release something, it’s always half-baked. The bugs that have existed for years are still there, and any potential new content just feels like a quick cash grab. It’s clear they stopped caring once they saw how much they could make.\n\nDo yourself a favor and save your money. There are way better horror games out there that actually work, are fun, and don’t waste your time. This game is a scam, and if you’re foolish enough to buy it, you’ll quickly realize you’ve been had. It’s frustrating, broken, and a complete waste of time. Seriously, just don’t.","1735257950","1735257950","False","3","1","0.52173912525177002","3","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

Room was living room and it turned out to be a Demon who killed me almost immediately after the initial grace period total of 5:38 seconds on the map and only had 6 sanity lost. Did find the room but found no evidence as by time I found the proper room time was just about up and there was little interaction till it decided to hunt.\n\nSo chalked it up to bad luck and tried again, Found the room earlier this time Laundry room and started focus there, getting lots of door touches and some closing but by time I got the UV there and other stuff it slowed down. By this time my grace is up and now the events are happening elsewhere in the corridor connecting the two kids rooms and bathroom...\n\nSo my starting experiance consists of just killing me for not immediately knowing what it was and deciding it's not enough difficulty trying to figure out what ghost it is with only the starting equipment gotta make it your chasing the ghost around to see if you can get the evidence.\n\nIf your into knowing everything about the game before you start or just like hard games that throw you into the deep end and expect you to figure it out with trial an error this might be for you playing single player.\n\nIf you like being taught through the game itself this is not it as single player.\n\nAs to why I don't play multiplayer, I find most multiplayer games have a good chance of having to deal with toxic players who expect you to be exceptional, at least in random lobbies. I also don't like ether dragging others down while I learn or just have them do the work so fast I don't get a chance to learn for myself.\n\nIMO there should be a currated map for new players that still has randomness to it but limits some of the trickier aspects, such as getting killed almost immediately by a demon, or letting it be one of the hardest rooms to identify due to the limited interactions, or not having the ghost be very active in multiple rooms/ changing rooms.\n\nNot asking for a give me as a first assignment, only something that let's you digest a smaller amount of what this game has in terms of the mechanics.\nRight now it's like telling a kid he has to eat a whole 10lb turkey as the first thing.\n\nYes I did the tutorial... It was something, learned very little from it and frankly it made little sense what it wanted from you. For example the UV part it tells you that you can charge the print... exempt it only accepts the single one on the exit door despite there being multiple ones. Is that actually relevent or just some bs restriction for the purpose of the tutorial, no f'n clue.\n\nBit of advice as well to the Dev team, the thermometer should not be that hard to read when the player is holding. Why am I having to swing around the room to find the one spot where the light is not glaring off it or not lighting it despite my flashlight / torch being on.

I would like to give this game a better review but there are some glaring issues that cannot be ignored.\n\n[h3] The lack of content: [h3] The objectives can feel repetitive after playing the game for some time and there are no other objectives to do, something cool like an optional exorcism would be an interesting objective. The evidence types have remained the same since launch (No secondary evidence doesn't count, I am talking about Primary evidence.)\n\n[h3] Performance [h3] The game has decent graphics yet even on high-end systems will underperform having occasional massive amounts of frame drops.\n\n[h3] Delays [h3] The delays are awful, ever since 2021 Horror 2.0 was promised to be released yet it never happened. It’s been promised to come out each year yet always results in a delay, at this point they should stop teasing Horror 2.0 unless it’s not getting delayed again like always. The roadmaps have been abandoned before.\n\nOverall the game isn’t bad however, I would say if someone gets this game don’t expect it to be fully finished until a few years pass, as this game has been in early access for over four years now.\n","1734903112","1734903112","False","4","0","0.538461565971374512","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

If you're a new player, I might suggest it. The thrill of being new would last you a bit of time. The lack of updates and transparency, constantly setting goals and not meeting them, the (lack of a better word) lazy last 3 holiday events leave this game at what I would currently rank as 2 stars. Heck- I didn't event have to play the most recent event to get the rewards. Just signed in and was rewarded immediately. I loved this game. I miss the thrill of playing this game and having content that is engaging or fun for long time players. Even the newest large map fell flat to me as a consumer. And I've been around for a couple new maps, so I know what to expect when maps drop. I miss what this game was and what it originally promised. I hope that my opinion changes again for the better.

Now, all of them feel pitifully weak, because in addition to reworking the flashlights, the developers made the game even darker - so dark, in fact, that even at maximum brightness, if you don't know the map like the back of your bloody hand, you WILL get lost, and you can't see at all without a flashlight.\r\n\r\nGame is still alright if you have a group to play it with, if you can get past the shoddy lighting rework.

Example replacing the old spirit box which actually used to raise the hairs on the back of my neck to some recorded messages provided by streamers, which half the time you can't understand anyway. Then there's now the community seasonal events that look like poor skin jobs to existing locations, when we used to get a whole remodel or new map, this is when other games are bringing out random generated locations. Then there's the community event rather than being a bonus addition has replaced existing seasonal events. Any drive to do the seasonal missions is gone, as I'm sorry grinding out the same maps continually is not fun as 4 maps re-skinned seems like minimum effort and I'm sorry doesn't fill me with any personal satisfaction knowing that it's not a personal accomplishment, but dependency on enough of the community to do so, but I guess streamer content needs to be fuelled.

Ghosts get stuck on random furniture, teleport you for no reason during hunts, or just stop doing anything. Equipment like DOTS projectors either bug out or don’t even work, which makes the whole experience frustrating instead of spooky. How am I supposed to enjoy the game when half of it doesn’t function?\n\n[b]Seasonal Events Are a Joke[/b]\nWho thought it was a good idea to make events community-based instead of personal? Instead of teaming up with your friends and grinding for rewards, you’re just waiting around for the community to finish everything. It’s boring, lazy, and takes away any sense of achievement. Feels like a participation trophy at this point.\n\n[b]Dev Communication? Nonexistent.[/b]\nThe devs don’t even post updates here anymore unless they’re trying to sell you $50 plushies. The Christmas event? Never even got an announcement. If you’re not in their Discord, you won’t hear about anything. It’s like they’re purposely leaving the Steam community in the dark, which is just weird for a game this size.\n\n[b]Updates? Nah, Just Lazy Promises[/b]\nHorror 2.0 has been sitting on their Trello board since, like, 2021, and now it’s in the backlog. Meanwhile, the console release somehow went from “in progress” to “done” in less than a year. Priorities much? It feels like they’ve given up on making the game better and are just rushing out whatever they can to make more money.\n\n[b]Merch Over the Game? Seriously?[/b]\nInstead of fixing the game, they’re out here dropping overpriced merch and collectibles like we’re gonna eat that up. Newsflash: I’d rather play a working game than buy another plushie.\n\n[b]The Game Is Boring Now[/b]\nI’ll be for real... Phasmophobia used to be fun, but now it’s just the same thing over and over. The gameplay is stale, the bugs are annoying, and there’s nothing new to keep me hooked. It feels like the devs grabbed their money and dipped.\n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\nPhasmophobia had the chance to be something amazing, but the devs are dropping the ball big time. Between the bugs, lazy updates, and radio silence, it’s hard to care about this game anymore. Unless they actually start fixing things and stop pushing overpriced junk, this game’s gonna die out faster than a ghost hunt gone wrong.","1734350591","1734350666","False","0","0","0.454545468091964722","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

The challenge modes and self induced handicaps extend the life of the game a tiny bit, but ultimately Phasmo is just too shallow of a game to enjoy long term.\n\nTo the dev's - It  may be wise to finish production of your game before releasing more merchandise. Sure, the merch probably doesn't take your attention away from development, but as a player, it sucks to see little trinkets for sale instead of completed features in a game I already paid for. Please breathe some life into this game - I'd love to see some character customization, maybe a skill tree or particular roles for investigation. I'd really appreciate a way to capture or banish the ghost instead of just figuring out that it's another Hantu and leaving the map. \n\nAlso - Please, PLEASE address the players run duration.

This is not gernerally an issue per se as it is an early access game after all, but the developers don't seem interested in addressing even the most blatant bugs. For example: A few months ago they switched to new voice chat backend (Vivox). This however broke voice chat in the lobby (it works once you load into a map, but you'll pretty much always be kicked before due to you being unable to communicate) as well as voice recognition for many people. Rather than reverting to the previous voice chat backend (Phonon), the developers just ignored the problem, leaving the game in an essentially broken state for many players for months now. Even critical issues like this remain unaddressed when the fix would be as easy as just reverting a change. Also, many old bugs were never addressed, making this game feel like it falls more and more into disrepair with every update\n\n* Performance - falls into a similar category of the game accumulating more and more technical debt. Where you could easily run the 2020 version of the game on a low-end machine back then, these days you'll get occasional massive lags even on a mid- to high-end machine.\n\n* Lack of content - In the past (2020/2021) this game used to have an open beta where you could try out new or changed content. Updates on that branch would range from once a week to multiple times a day. While most of the updates were of course minor changes and fixes, you basically got a game mechanics improvement, changed ghost mechanics etc pretty much every other week. They listend to feedback to finetune these changes before pushing them to the release build every few months. Mid-2021 they stopped doing this open kind of development and in turn promised to release regular big updates as a kind of big content/mechanics drops and when the 0.3 update arrived a while after, it was a massive success. It overhauled lots of equipment, their effects, how they interact with ghost hunts, introduced a new evidence, changed the existing ghost evidences around, introduced new ghosts - overall just great. The next update 0.4 came not that long after and was the 2021 halloween update and was just as great, adding a new map, having some doors start open (so that coming across an open door no longer means ghost room) allowing ghosts to change rooms and adding a new difficulty, After that however, new content pretty much stalled. 0.5 would add cursed posessions which are fine, but for the most part just gimmicky things. 0.6 was just a VR overhaul which - in typical Phasmophobia fashion - broke VR completely for a good bunch of VR players - the issues remain unaddressed to this day.\nNow we're starting to get to the point where the game went into a very poor direction. Many people at the time were already complaining about the lack of meaningful content for the majority of people - especially with the long awaited ""Horror 2.0"" being delayed again and again (it's still not out by this day), so the developers promised a complete makeover of the Asylum map (which was the by far largest map at the time, but many rooms looked very similar). This then came in the 0.7 update in form of the Sunny Meadows map which shares nothing with the original Asylum map (other than both being an insane asylum), performs much worse and doesn't play very well with the game's mechanics. Many rooms still feel pretty much the same (even though usually more detailed). The tone also feels very off compared to the rest of the game. The rest of the locations may be creepy (such as the abandoned high school or prison), but were always just that and nothing more, never the big evil place where so many spooky things are happening. On Sunny Meadows you have screams in the hallways, rooms with the floor just covered in blood and human remains, rooms where the floor is covered with removed jaws, etc. They also removed the original Asylum map with that patch, preventing the players who liked it to play that map any longer. To the developer's credit: The 0.7 update also brought the 2021 halloween event which was the first and also most fun event they ever did. You had to play on nightmare mode on a few maps, collect all hidden candy which would then spawn pumpkins which you all had to light which would then cause the ghost to wear a pumpkin hat which you had to photograph. Do all of that and identify the ghost. Not too hard, but fun. The patch didn't introduce new game mechanics, it just took away a beloved map and replaced it with one that doesn't play well.\nNext was the ""player progression"" update which was the worst design decision made regarding this game. Rather than leveling up endlessly as previously, they reset everyone's level to 1 and once you reach level 100 you can press a button to reset your level back to 1, losing all unlocks in the process. I don't know how they ever thought that this would even remotely be a good idea. To the developer's credit: They announced these plans about a year in advance. Everyone hated it. They went through with it regardless and ignored all player feedback - everyone still hated it. No new actual game mechanics again. Even after these lackluster updates, there was no new ""major"" update until nearly a year later which only added a new lighthouse map which - surprise - doesn't play very well.\nWhich brings us to the 0.11 update which replaced the task-based seasonal events with community events where it's just ""photograph/use these randomly spawned things and/or complete the mission to contribute to a big score pool"", nothing else.\nIf you paid attention, you may have noticed that not much has changed for the positive since the addition of the cursed posessions about three years ago. The game has gotten stagnant. The developers have gotten too comfortable on the hype that was around it to the point that games which started out as just Phasmophobia clones like Ghost Exile these days offer a much more engaging and in-depth gameplay than Phasmophobia does and have surpassed their master \n\n* Ignoring the players\nNow this is highly subjective, but they used parts of the money and ressources they gained through Steam's early access program to port this game to consoles rather than using the ressources to overhaul things, add new mechanics, fix bugs, etc in the actual game to bring it closer to release. Nobody would have cared if this were already a fully released title, but with an early access title, there's the expectation that the money earned is used to actually finish the game rather than to swim on the hype train and also milk console players for their money. This gets even worse as the developers have completely stopped publishing changelogs for their patches through Steam (even though it would just be a copy-paste action for them), so if you want to see changelogs, you now have to go to their website. Their reason being that they just want one place for all players to view changelogs. Why they can't copypaste these into Steam like every other dev out there does is beyond me.\n","1734024089","1734024089","False","16","0","0.601062357425689697","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

Mastering the game is rewarding, but precisely after digging deeper, you'll find an [i]ultimately unrefined and often frustrating title that fails to live up to anything worthwhile.[/i]\n\nPhasmophobia feels like a prototype that never fully matured, or a demo stretched too thin. Many ghosts share similar patterns, and when they do try something unique—like the Wraith's teleportation or other specialized behaviors—most these mechanics end up feeling unfair or inconsistent rather than challenging. There's no satisfying sense of discovery, and the mechanical puzzle-solving is too shallow; it's mostly waiting, trial and error, with a lot of inconsistencies along the way if you're not using evidences.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nThe game's evidence system itself quickly feels shallow. Collecting clues is a mechanical routine rather than an engaging and dynamic process. You're essentially rotating through the same handful of tools — EMF readers, UV lights, spirit boxes — just waiting for something to happen, with very minor variations between them, such as switching to UV if you hear a door. Despite having numerous ghost types, most of them feel interchangeable in this regard, relying on the same handful of generic evidence items. There's little in the way of interesting traits or unique behavior patterns that would truly differentiate one ghost from another, even if you're playing no evidence contracts. All this leaves the game with a lack of gameplay depth or variety.\n\nHere's a concise example of poor design in Phasmophobia: every ghost has traits that can help identify them. This is particularly important in ""no evidence"" contracts, where (with one specific exception) evidence tools cannot be used to determine the ghost type. This is great! However, other than some traits being simply inconsistent or cumbersome to test, there are ghost traits that depend directly on timers, which the game doesn't provide you with at all. There is simply no in-game way to tell the passage of time, so you have to rely on external tools to keep track of ghost behavior: LiveSplit, a phone you can quickly juggle between, etc. This not only breaks immersion but also [b]throws a challenge that the player has no in-game tools to deal with[/b], unless you're good at counting up to 300 seconds in your head while multitasking 2-3 other things. You also can't customize the pool of ghosts, and neither the game nor its developers support or encourage modding. This could be solved by adding a stopwatch item to the game.\nI assure you, there are many more examples of bad design in Phasmophobia, such as limiting the number of photos you can take (also the tier 2 camera delay after taking them), but I'll leave it at that.\n\nBasic quality-of-life features are missing or badly implemented. There's no proper hotbar, so you're forced to juggle items with the scroll wheel, which is awful. Sprinting mechanics are clunky; 'toggle sprint' remains active even after your character depletes its extremely short stamina. Until very recently, joining private lobbies was needlessly complicated, using 6-digit codes (that's 1 million CONCURRENT lobbies — up to [i]4 million players connected in multiplayer![/i]) rather than taking advantage of Steam's API. It's baffling that a game so engaged with multiplayer makes such simple tasks feel so wearisome, with microphone levels resetting every time you enter a new lobby, etc.\n\nPhasmophobia's older maps, which constitute the majority, show very little effort in environmental storytelling. Sound design is mechanically poor, with transitions between exteriors and different floors being extremely noticeable. These shortcomings undermine what should be a core strength of a horror game: atmosphere.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nIn the end, Kinetic Games has failed in coming up with dynamic systems or combining the existing pieces into an orthogonal design, which would have made the game more engaging and replayable. The game's core loop is repetitive and lacks depth, and [b]the game's design often contradicts itself[/b], leading to a frustrating and unpolished experience. \n\nPhasmophobia is a game that can be fun to learn and play with friends, but that's generally despite its design, [i]not[/i] because of it.","1733714714","1733715226","False","6","1","0.526523828506469727","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

In a lot of ways, I feel like it really kicked off this template of ghost hunting game. It was inventive, fun, and genuinely has (and still does) jump scare potential. That being said, it's apparent there are much better alternatives out there to play and almost all are better. I would only recommend picking up Phasmophobia on a deep discount in the same way I'd recommend checking out the original version of a game to see how far they've come.\r\n\r\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of what I think doesn't work:\r\n- Lot's of events but very few updates of substance like new levels, better ghost behavior etc...\r\n- You don't get a genuine sense of hunting or surprise from the ghost, it feels like it is on rails, either being too difficult or too easy\r\n- Not enough changes to ghost behavior, you've seen how it acts once, you've seen it all\r\n- Overly used environments, everything feels the same. I'd like to see the level progress with the hunt.\r\n- Developer reset original player progression to a new system and level locked the better version of tools instead of recognizing long time players. Hopping back in now feels slow and progress is punishing to get the better gear. I feel like they may think this is a hook, but it's prohibitive. \r\n- Again, leveling to getting better gear just is not fun.

I don’t need a proton pack or whatever gadget these ghost nerds use. If there were ghosts, they’d run screaming the moment I stepped into their haunted little house. But in this game, I’m expected to… what? Hide? Take blurry photos? Use some spirit box that sounds like static? That’s beneath me.\n\nAnd the equipment! Flashlights that flicker at the worst time, cameras that barely work what is this, amateur hour? Do you know who I am? I could laser through walls to find these so-called “spirits” in seconds. But no, this game insists I crawl around like some powerless human. It’s pathetic.\n\nAnd don’t get me started on the gameplay. You wander around dark houses or abandoned schools with your friends, looking for signs of ghosts. But most of the time, it’s just waiting for something to happen. I don’t wait. The idea of Homelander being vulnerable to a ghost hunt is downright insulting.\n\nThe “fear factor” everyone keeps raving about? Oh, please. I’m the most terrifying thing in any room. A ghost that can flicker lights or breathe on your neck isn’t going to faze someone like me. Honestly, it’s cute they think this is scary. You want scary? Try staring into my glowing red eyes when I’m pissed off. That’s terror.\n\nThe one thing this game does well is showing how helpless most people are. Watching others scream and scramble when the ghost attacks? Now that’s entertaining almost makes up for the mind-numbing gameplay.\n\nFinal verdict: Phasmophobia is a waste of time for anyone who’s already a god among men. But if you’re one of those weak, fragile humans who enjoys pretending to be brave, knock yourself out. Just don’t expect me to join your little ghost-hunting party.\n\nRating: 1/10.

But these last updates as of late, mainly the item progression update, just completely sucked all the fun out of this game. I feel like DKnighter's always had a problem with adding more shit instead of refining what existed, but now it's really hit a boiling point.\n\nPhasmo used to be a simple pick and play affair. Having to grind and grind to simply get back to where we began when the game first dropped just sucks. Item progression is not remotely interesting, nor is being locked out of so many items I used to be able to get no problem. It all feels so artificial and forced... OK well that's because it is forced. At most beforehand, you were just grinding up money, but if you were good at the game this really wasn't an issue. This new item system just completely kills the pace in ways I can't begin to describe. It's so draining.\n\nAlso the UI just straight up sucks now, the original store UI was flat in presentation yeah but it was effective. The first store UI overhaul just looked like ass and was incredibly cumbersome to navigate and the current store UI is even worse. It really frustrates me to see things that weren't broken being ""fixed"", resulting in an infinitely worse state now. It's ""3 Lefts to Make a Right"": The Game. Every time I try to throw the current state of the game a bone I just find myself wiped out by the menu navigation and artificial limitations.\n\nRecent maps have been hit and miss. Some maps like the new (I say this despite it having come out a long while ago) Asylum being pretty decent, and a considerable improvement over the original Asylum, but then you have the Lighthouse map which is such a pain to navigate.\n\nI really hate to give DKnighter a lot of shit, but it just feels like him and his team's priorities are so fucking out of order. On God, what Phasmophobia has become is not too dissimilar to what the Star Wars Special Editions did to those movies. Playing this game in 2024 is just a draining experience to reach a the most basic level of enjoyment the game had in 2020. \n\nThe game still does really well if the Steam Charts are any indication, and that's cool, I am at least happy to see the game is  still successful, but I can't help but feel like players like me and my friends have been completely left in the dust.","1731388097","1731388097","False","3","0","0.505693316459655762","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

Both for lack of unpredictable spooks, but also cause the core gameplay takes a long while to actually get engaging without frustration, and the learning curve is extremely steep. \n\nThe core gameplay loop is theoretically not reliant on you having all the items available, but having to play without items is simply not fun. Getting all the items requires a lot of cash. The cash starts coming in quicker once you get more items to guess the ghost better, but getting the cash in the first place is the issue, as you won't be able to guess the ghost consistently without the items. See the paradox this creates? You're essentially punished for simply starting the game, by instantly being put at a major disadvantage to the games intended core loop. Compare this to something like Lethal Company where you start out with all the tools you need (your 4 inventory slots and your scanner), and buying more items simply enhance your effectiveness. \n\nAnd this isn't even to mention how confusing Phasmophobia is for beginners. The tutorial NEEDS to be forced. There is no reality in where a game, wherein you are reliant on so many different abstract gadgets and trinkets to succeed, shouldn't be holding your hand for the first many hours. I have watched countless hours of content creators play the game, and put in 11 hours myself at time of writing, and I was STILL surprised to hear from a friend that the game has a tutorial. Because it's optional, and hidden away in some menu! It's flabbergasting. \n\nI know that the game starts getting really engaging and (subjectively) actually scary in the lategame, as you unlock massive locations, properly fitting of the games type of horror. However, the game starting you out in small suburban homes really does it a disservice. The ambient horror happening around you feels extremely scripted. The scares being limited to doors creaking open, lights flashing, noises in the dark, and eventually the ghost awkwardly waddling towards you while flashing like a poorly made GIF, just does not make for engaging horror. I've played enough Roblox to be able to recognize when an enemy is just pathing in a direct line towards you. It makes it feel synthetic. It reads more like a really low budget amateur horror movie, a piece of media not confident enough to be creative with their scares. \n\nI believe that Phasmophobia has a TON of potential to become a really properly scary co-op horror game. It gets points for being one of the very few co-op horror games on the market that actually takes itself seriously, and isn't just an amateurish college project. But I would not recommend it to someone who doesn't already have friends very experienced in it and willing to teach you the ropes, as the game, at time of writing, just doesn't seem interested enough in retaining new players.","1731286705","1732065097","False","4","0","0.537878811359405518","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

But after hiring new staff it slowly became worse with each update, i'll list what are, in my opinion, the main issues with this game:\n\n[b] Balancement and grinding [/b] : More than an year ago the game got reset because of an update featuring tiered items, the problem with that was that you needed dozens of hours to basically go back to what you where already using before the update, and each update after that made the grinding for these items slower and slower, basically making the new player experience unbearable. At the same time it became a lot more difficult because they made the ghost abilities much more confusing and pushing for looping the ghost around tables instead of finding hiding spots or anyway trying to stay away from the ghost.\n\n[b] Community and content creators [/b] : Because of the grind most of the casual players were pushed away from the game, and the remaining part of the community became an elitist mess who discarded every type of criticism and just told to new players to ""get gud"" when they said something against the confusing gameplay loop or about the ghost abilities that did not praise the developers or the game. Meanwhile thanks to some youtubers and QA testers it was discovered that the developers themselves only listened to their close friends instead of the community as whole, they allowed some official content creators to abuse game bugs to have an advantage and reacted poorly to the criticism of each one who wasn't their friend.\n\n[b] Lack of updates and shortage of staff [/b] : The game sold a lot of copies but the main developer never hired more than 3-4 people because he said i wanted to keep his ""vision""of the game, the game though suffered a lot as a result because of the extremely long time between each content update, at the moment between the two newest content updates has passed more than 1 year and recently we only got a poor Halloween event and the console release that if they don't hire more stuff, will mean an even slower development of new content, as is said though, the main developer is too stubborn to hire new stuff and to listen to the part of the community that criticizes the game.\n\n\nAll things considered this game is on a collision course with a really sad ending, that it could only be prevented by developers and community listening to each other, but i don't have much hope that it will happen. \n\nI want to thank you if you read my review and i hope i helped you in deciding if you want to buy the game or not, i'll write a small TL:DR on the bottom.\n\n\nTL:DR: The game is not user friendly, requires a lot of grinding to get the best items and the developer don't listen to the community and make blatant favoritism.\n","1731014513","1731014513","False","13","0","0.535824954509735107","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

'Yes sir, you have a ghost in your bathroom... anyway BYE'\n\nWhat a huge disappointment, this game has been hyped up to me over the years, and honestly its boring, frustrating and not remotely scary.\n\n- The game throws far too much at you without sufficient explanation.\n- Janky animations and goofy character models that ruin the spooky atmosphere.\n- The least immersive proximity chat I've encountered, regular audio cut-outs, volume to distance ratio isn't great, no room reverb (aside from specific levels). And the low-pass filter pops in and out. We gave up on it after 1 game.\n- No U.I elements to check on your sanity level, you have to go all the way to the truck just to check it. how fun.\n\nI felt like i gave the game plenty of chances, tried my best to engage with the mechanics, and tbh, it just kinda sucks.

It gets very repetitive very fast, almost bureaucratic. Some maps are just too big so it takes 15 minutes to find where the ghost is, which means you'll be spending 15 minutes just wandering around in the dark while nothing happens.\r\n\r\nIf you want an example of a well made investigation game look at Shadows of Doubt.\r\n\r\nI won't comment on the scare factor becase most games/movies generally don't scare me & this is not an exception, though i will say that the hunts feel very underwhelming & that i did not realize i was killed the first time i died, the animations are that bad.\r\n\r\nBesides the glaring game design problems, the game is technically quite bad: The game's physics runs at 60 Hz no matter the refresh rate of your screen, which would be fine if it had interpolation between frames, but alas it does not so the simple act of moving your character feels weird and jittery. This could easily be solved since the game is clearly made with Unity & other unity games do not suffer from this, but the abundance of store bought assets explains a lot.\r\n\r\nSmall nitpick: not being able to mess with your friends while dead really detracts form the ""party game"" vibe & makes being dead quite boring.","1730856489","1732571336","False","1","0","0.503722071647644043","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

The firm resistance against mods + lack of new content for the game.\nThe devs are firm in their stance against mods, even to the point of banning the topic of mods in the community discord. This has been in the name of ""protecting the vision"" of the game, which I could fully respect IF there was a meaningful amount of improvements and new content being added.\n\nThere's been ONE new map released in the last year, that's an unplayable labyrinth (The Lighthouse), and makes the round a chore to play. The events, such as the Blood Moon event, feel super lazy with minimal map changes that get old fast, and require hours of grind to see a, DRUMROLL, new player card background. \n\nThe store is a consistent mess and is honestly in it's best in it's current iteration, but is clunky and limited by its ALWAYS PRESENT first time hint UI. \n\nThe amount of money this games makes (revenue estimated in of hundreds of millions) and all there is to show is 13 maps, half-baked events, and coupled with gross behavior from the dev + QA team, I don't recommend this game.","1730587399","1730587399","False","7","0","0.562952518463134766","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

Get fucked Kinetic games.\n\nHire QA instead of using/exploiting free labour from teenagers and also stop abusing them.  It's no wonder the game still suffers from obvious bugs and issues. [b] Fire the abusers [/b]  Contrary to popular belief, these kinds of people do NOT belong in this industry.  Video-game devs try not to be worthless cunts challenge 2024 (impossible).  Multi-million dollar game btw.  \n\nEDIT:  They've dug their heels in and decided to keep the abusers.  DKnighter, hope your game rots.  Get a reality check.  Fucking 'tard.\n\nAlso their Discord mods are a bit embarrassing (but then again what Moderator isn't now-a-days?  Reddit, Discord etc.  Pretending their isn't a problem and silencing anyone that brings it up.  Very good look on their part.\n\n\n[i] In Phasmophobia you play as a ghost hunter with up to 3 other players (can be played solo offline if you want).  You pick your level, your difficulty and prepare what gear you want to bring in with you.  You enter, find the ghosts favourite room and proceed to use the tools and information available to you to deduce what kind of Ghost it is.  You can complete side objectives and take photographs for extra cash/xp.  There will also be a couple of powerful items within the level you may want to find and possibly make use of, much to the potential detriment of yourself.  Afterwards you leave, hoping you collected enough evidence to deduce the kind of ghost.  If you succeeded, you earn xp to level up and unlock higher tiers of equipment and money to buy said equipment and upgrades.\n\nWhile doing all of the above, the ghost will do what it can to lower your sanity, obfuscate it's behaviours and evidence and eventually try to kill you/your party.  These behaviours can vary depending on the kind of ghost.  Some can be more obvious than others.  Some, due to occasionally shitty RNG, really really hide their evidences.  If a player dies they continue on as a spirit with very little ability to help the remaining players.  You lose whatever items you brought, meaning you will have to spend money repurchasing those tools.  [/i]\n\nThe actual game is pretty fun, addictive even.  The puzzle aspect is enjoyable once you start reducing the evidence the ghost can give out.  It makes it so you have to intentionally get it to Hunt to gather extra information you wouldn't normally look for.  Granted, that kind of info is fairly hard to learn without looking stuff up.  It's fairly chill with the occasional ""Oh Shit!"" moment. \n\nThere are multiple difficulties you can even customise your own difficulty with varying parameters and earn less or more XP/Cash depending on the modifiers.\n\nThe game is very unwelcoming to new players.  Information in-game is fairly obtuse.  The grind is also abysmal.  The starting player tools are genuinely awful and it wouldn't surprise me if most noobs quit after their first few games.\n\nIt still lacks some fairly basic features like a HUD that tells you the equipment you are carrying, how much of it you have left to use etc.  Not even 1,2,3,4 key-binds for your items??  Scroll and Q are clunky to use.  You get used to it but it could be so much better.  Hell what about a inventory wheel like a lot of FPS games have been doing lately?\n\nIt is comprised mostly of Unity Store Assets, but they are used very well and cohesively.  On one hand, I personally feel these need to be removed and updated to original in-house stuff. \n Otherwise it's just sheer laziness at this point.  Speaking of which though nothing has ever really felt out of place except for the player character models themselves which as I understand are due to be changed fairly soon if there road-map is to even be believed at this point given their history lmfao.\n\nAlso, dev is against mods because ""they go against their artistic vision.""  Saying that about an asset flip is daring.\n\nFTR; I've played this roughly since EA release on Steam.  It's a lot better than it was but still feels like a Minimum Viable Product.  I understand it had a solo dev for a while who then eventually started hiring, so of course progress is slow.\n\nUntil they sort out the issues at the very start of this review, I'm keeping this negative.  Don't support abusers kthanks.","1730570130","1732463005","False","4","0","0.499241262674331665","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

From the beginning, all the shop and inventory menus are laid out in a way that comes across as cluttered and overstimulating, like a chore to work through. While it gives you a tutorial from the start on how to work these menus, I feel they shouldn't be cluttered enough to need a tutorial to begin with. In terms of gameplay, it's similar to that of a real life ""ghost hunt,"" however with problems. Sure, you can investigate and collect evidence toward discovering the identity of the ghost in question, but in the end you're never going to pin down the correct entity. It doesn't matter what evidence you gather or what ghosts you see on your screen, the game will actively ignore all of this, rarely give you checkmarks, and make up an entity that disregards all prior evidence. Speaking of the ghosts, it's not likely you'll even encounter it to begin with. The bigger the map gets, the more your game time will consist of wandering the building with your limited set of tools, hoping something bites, and once it does you're already dead anyway. Worst of all, it's just not scary. The animation and art style tries to be realistic, funny, and scary at the same time but just comes off as unpolished; it feels like it doesn't know what it wants to be. The only real fun I had in the game was throwing basketballs and Jenga blocks at my friends in the lobby. At the time of this review, I would not recommend buying the game especially for its $20 price tag.","1730528470","1730528470","False","3","0","0.518828451633453369","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

It can absolutely get spooky with its jump scares and the anxiety of knowing the ghost could literally hunt you at anytime is nail biting at times. It is a fun game to play with friends or solo and there is a significant learning curve to how each individual ghost works.\r\n\r\nBUT\r\n\r\nIt is a very grindy and relatively pointless adventure. For those looking at this game for the first time, you are a ghost ""Identifier"". You are given a good handful of locations to go to which can range from a single story house to a long abandoned and maze like asylum. Once you arrive at your selected location, you will always have the same main objective- gather 3 pieces of evidence  with various items, identify the ghost, get out. You are always provided with 3 additional objectives to earn extra money, however at the start, you may not be able to do these objectives. \r\n\r\nAs you progress, and unlock more/ better items, you are able to use them to identify ghosts easier...sometimes. You are also given other items that can help with survival, hunts, completing secondary objectives, and help narrow down the identification of a ghost without needing evidence.....sometimes. \r\n\r\nThat's more or less the entire game. You're never given a reason why you're doing these investigations, nor is there ever any kind of story that explains things as you continue.  Your only form of progress is unlocking items and gaining knowledge on ghosts as you learn general behaviors. If you're an achievement hunter or someone who likes to 100% games, then enjoy endless repetition of  finding the room the ghost is in, gathering information while completing objectives, and then leaving. \r\n\r\nThis is a very watered down description of what you will be doing. Obviously there is more challenge and randomization in how each ghost works, but once you've completed one investigation, you've basically done 80% of what the game has to offer you. \r\n\r\nMy experience with the game ranges from solo to being the brave one to complete things while someone watches from the van to being part of a pretty decent investigation team. I've been playing this game off and on for about 2 years and I can say with a strong level of certainty that I can only play 1-4 investigations before I'm so bored that I would rather do anything else. I will play the game when it updates, check out the new things, then shelf it until the next update rolls around. I can't stomach it for longer, especially when the ghost is being extremely difficult or there is some kind of bug that absolutely obliterates my interest. \r\n\r\nAt the time of writing this review, the game launched its 2024 Halloween event. In the past, holiday events were themed Easter Egg hunts and a string of little challenges that ultimately unlocked some minor cosmetic change and a little trophy. It was cute and fun for a couple of days and often brought me back for a little longer just so I could enjoy the vibes that each map brought.\r\n\r\nHowever with this event, the devs decided to make the reward progress tied to the entire community's progress. I will say that the decoration of the maps is absolutely spot on and does indeed give the chosen maps a nice and refreshing glow up. But in place of the cute Easter Egg hunt and simple puzzles, you are tasked with taking pictures of these small monolith like structures that appear in random locations on the designated maps and in random amounts. Once you do that, you go about the investigation like normal, though this time the ghost is extremely active and extremely aggressive. \r\n\r\nThis is a welcome challenge...until you see how little progress is made in the community's reward progress. Each reward is tracked by percentage and there are 3 rewards. The community has until November 13th to do as much as they can to try and get all 3 rewards. It's been 24 hours since the launch of the event and the community has managed to complete under 1.5% of the first reward. If you are halfway decent at math, then you'll know that in 15 days and at the same percentage increase per day, then you'll see that its not enough progress to get even half way through the first reward's progress bar, let alone all 3. \r\n\r\nAdd in that the game's means to progress this bar has very little change in terms of overall game play AND is actively harder for everyone, including new players, and it just makes the game (for me) even more frustrating and tedious to play. There also isn't even a requirement for participation, you can be someone who can just come in at the end of the event's run and collect whatever rewards have been unlocked, and then dip. \r\n\r\nSo with all that said:\r\n\r\nThe game is extremely repetetive.\r\nThe game is grindy.\r\nThe game is challenging, but sometimes not in a good way due to ghost RNG or bugs.\r\nThe game  is often poorly balanced in what it asks players to do to get achievements and fun little rewards to keep players intrigued.\r\n\r\nAnd the big one for me\r\n\r\nOther than a new map, new ghost type, new equipment, and a few quality of life changes here and there (some good, some bad), there is very little that has changed about this game in 2 years since I have been playing it and even in its 1.0 state, the amount of unappealing (looking at you player models) , grindy, and buggy things allowed to still be in this game is absolutely baffeling","1730256486","1730256486","False","1","0","0.509803950786590576","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

It just isn't what it was on launch and Im not cool with that but I can't say the changes were the worst.\n\nThe game was a fun horror 'party' game to play with friends when it came out. You could give yourself money, buy the limited equipment choice, and just have a good time with friends. That being said there wasn't much progress to make within the game. No cosmetics to unlock, gear to unlock, or maps to unlock. Everything was kinda just given to you. They eventually added actual progression which is cool and all but they also reset everyone. So everyone returning to the game had no levels, no money, and started with the new basic tier of equipment. This immediately killed the game for me. Getting demoted from a temp gun to a literal mercury thermometer is INSANE punishment for buying this game. They also keep releasing huge maps. The amount of time I've wasted walking around the school just waiting for the red line to drop in the thermometer isn't quantifiable. \n\nThere's other red flags such as: 4 years of early access, an aggressive EULA, and they'll ban you for using any sort of mods, cosmetic or otherwise.\n\nOverall the game was amazing and if you buy it today you might think it is with their new changes.

And the attitude and lack of care that the devs present is abominable. \nDo not buy the game unless you are ready to rely on the internet/community to get any help, with the problems that are sure to arise as you play the game, because you will not get any help from the creators.","1730120778","1730124695","False","3","0","0.516698956489562988","2","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

The avatars are still using Unity asset store models, the game is quite poorly optimised considering its visuals, and the main gameplay loop leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nThe current main goal of the game is simply to get money, nothing else. You complete an investigation, complete quests, and then get money that lets you buy items to make each investigation easier. The more you play the game, the easier it gets, which feels entirely backwards. Worse yet, you lose your hard earned items upon failing an investigation. You now need money again, and essentially have to farm multiple easier investigations for a single shot at a harder one. Genuinely think the game would be a lot better if there was any other reason to earn money than simply better gear.\n\nIt absolutely does not help that the shop menu is completely abysmal. I genuinely cannot for the life of me understand how it works. It was quite bad previously, but it's even worse now, and there doesn't seem to be any signs of it changing anytime soon. I'd have never understood how the previous menu worked without having it explained to me by a friend, but the new one makes me not want to engage with the shop whatsoever - I just let others buy things for the group.\n\nWhile I do like playing in VR, the PSVR2 version of the game having to utilise both dynamic foveated rendering [i]and[/i] reprojection says a lot about how poor the conversion is in terms of performance.\n\nEven though it's lost its novelty over the years, proximity chat in this kind of setup is still great, and allows for some funny moments with friends, but it's just massively disappointing that the game is still in early access. I suspect all of the game's issues will still be present if the game ever gets a full release as well. The success of Phasmophobia inspired a lot of other games of a similar ilk, and most of these are just far more enjoyable than the one that started it all.","1729813356","1729886064","False","0","0","0","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

It gets so incredibly stale, progression moves at a snails pace, and it feels like there's only two ways to enjoy the game. When you first play it and everything is still scary and new, and after you've invest a stupid amount of time to learn every possible mechanic and ghost behaviour down to the timing and intervals of their interactions, and being between these two is just so boring. It stops being scary and stops being fun, just waiting around for evidence to appear is worse than watching paint dry.","1728441649","1728441649","False","3","0","0.508928596973419189","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

There's tiered versions of the items which really restricts the gameplay since you won't just fail by not finding the evidence, you simply won't find the evidence because the early versions of the items suck, which also makes levelling up incredibly slow since you need to win to get sufficient XP. The UI for the shop and inventory is also unnecessarily messy with bad layouts and interaction. Frankly, this game used to be really good but now it just makes you never want to touch it again.

It'll take AGES with the beginning equipment and 10 times out of 10 you'll die before you can even find it. Its super irritating, and really boring to wave an EMF reader around and it teasing you with ""OOO ITS 4 BUT YOU WONT GET 5"" Or the edging with the thermometer. I'm tired of it. Solid ""Meh"" :P\n\nI honestly feel like a hunt killing you right off the bat is not great. I think if a ghost catches you during a hunt it should significantly lower your sanity rather than killing you right off the bat, only killing you when you reach 0. It just feels like everytime I start getting into the spook of the game I die and its in a really corny non-immersive jarring manner. I don't think I've heard once of a ghost (irl) reaching around behind you like a peek-a-boo doll and going ""GUESS WHO"" to kill you. I just feel the game needs a lot of refinement around the hunts to give more of a spook factor rather than ""how fast can you wait"".\n\nThe Mimic is a good idea, isn't very good execution. Rather than only mimicing ghost orbs, it should have a passive that picks a random piece of evidence to mimic. It would make it more engaging rather than everytime you see ghost orbs you groan. I absolutely loathe it when I think I have all the evidence I need only for the screen to go ""Nah fam, its a mimic, you didn't sit there for 5 more minutes asking words into a box in the dark.""\n\nI understand not having a lot of sprint on small maps to balance it out, but on the big maps it is just pain. It makes me not want to play any of the amazing hand crafted maps you guys have because they're just too big to enjoy. Are our characters 500 pounds? Have they never ran anywhere their entire lives? Its just a bit.... Lame.\n\nOther than those gripes, a very okay game to play. Its nice to relax to after coming home from work, and can be fun at times. Just not the most immersive or amazing ghost hunting game on the planet. Mods and modded lobbies would benefit this game tenfold.\n\nThe spirit box is wholey unreliable no matter what ""tier"" it is. You absolutely need to make the ghost talk more often on the damned thing. You get instant every other piece of evidence but when it comes to the spirit box you're just sitting there repeating yourself over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. Its not fun, either give it some more trigger phrases or make the ghost talk more often. If the spirit box is fixed the review would be positive. I mean, Spirit box is literally the first thing every single ghost hunt youtuber, show writer, and kook uses to ""prove"" ghosts are real and its the most reliable way of doing so, why isn't this in the game as well?","1728321248","1729277810","False","0","0","0","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

While it initially captures your attention with its creepy atmosphere and unique co-op gameplay, it quickly becomes stale due to a variety of frustrating issues. First and foremost, the progression system feels non-existent. Once you’ve played a handful of rounds, you've essentially seen everything. The ghost types, while varied on paper, often behave in similar ways, making each hunt feel repetitive. There’s little to no sense of advancement, and unlocking equipment doesn’t provide the satisfaction or depth you would expect from a game in this genre.\nThe AI, which is central to the fear factor, is inconsistent at best and laughably predictable at worst. Ghosts often glitch, get stuck in certain areas, or become easy to manipulate, removing any real tension from hunts. And for a game that thrives on suspense, that’s a huge letdown. Multiplayer, while fun with friends, quickly becomes a chore when faced with technical issues. Lag, disconnections, and server instability plague the experience, and playing with random players is hit-or-miss due to lack of moderation or proper matchmaking. The development team has been slow with meaningful updates, and while new maps or ghost types are welcome, they don’t fix the core issues of gameplay repetition and technical shortcomings. The game feels more like an Early Access title than a finished product, even after all this time. \nIn conclusion, Phasmophobia had the makings of a horror gem, but the developers seem content with its barebones structure.

Not one I'd personally play solo without some kind of chat, as it can get very repetitive. However if you find that style of game fun to play solo, absolutely take a spin.\n\nThe biggest problem I've encountered coming back to this game is just how many ghosts there are. While originally there were 9 ghosts, they were all distinct enough that it was possible to start getting haunts correctly identified once you got used to everything, especially with how big the maps sometimes are. While having a large amount of content (especially for long time players) is fantastic for replay ability, due to how overwhelming the amount of ghosts are with the small amount/ineffective equipment you get when you are playing at low level, it is such a steep learning curve that it becomes hard to enjoy even when you're with friends.\n\nI truly wish that the amateur level had less ghosts so it was easier for new players to get into (or relearn after a long time of not playing) or that there was a way to turn off certain ghosts to make it a more fun experience for casual players. \n\nAs much as I enjoy this game, I truly would not recommend this game for casual/new players unless you're willing and able to learn just about every ghost and top player technique until there is a way to properly ease into the game and the amount of work you have to do to discern against different ghosts.

The concept—a co-op ghost-hunting experience where you and your friends investigate haunted locations—sounds like a dream for horror fans. However, the execution often feels uneven.\n\nThe atmosphere and sound design are the game's strongest aspects, effectively creating a sense of dread that keeps you on edge. The first few hours of play are genuinely terrifying, especially when you’re still figuring out how to use your equipment and interpret the various signs of ghostly activity. But once that initial fear fades, the experience becomes repetitive and predictable.\n\nThe core gameplay loop, which involves identifying the type of ghost haunting a location, feels limited and lacks depth. There are only so many types of evidence to collect, and after a while, each investigation begins to feel the same. The variety of ghosts doesn’t provide enough differentiation to keep the gameplay fresh. The mechanics, while fun at first, start to feel more like busywork than engaging detective work.\n\nThe game also suffers from a lack of polish. There are frequent bugs and glitches that can pull you out of the immersion, from floating objects to strange character animations. The graphics are serviceable but not particularly impressive, and the controls can feel clunky, especially when trying to manage your equipment in the dark.\n\nAdditionally,[i] Phasmophobia [/i] relies heavily on its multiplayer component, and playing solo lacks the same appeal. The game’s tension and fun are significantly diminished without friends to share the experience, and the lack of a more substantial single-player mode is a missed opportunity.\n\nOverall,[i] Phasmophobia [/i] has its moments, and if you’re playing with a group of friends, you’re likely to have some fun and a few scares. But the lack of variety, polish, and depth means that the game quickly loses its shine. It’s worth trying, but it might not hold your attention for long.","1724976745","1724976745","False","7","0","0.518679678440093994","4","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

Point hope is still heavily broken. Some of the ghosts have become even buggier (somehow it got worse). Multiple of my friends that still play the game have had ghosts go invisible and hunt then kill them. Ghost behaviors are still as messed up as always. Makes it difficult to play nightmare difficulty when the ghost doesn't behave the way it is supposed to. A couple examples being, silent Banshees, Oni's that refuse to hunt until forced to with a cursed possession, ect. The devs still act the same so nothing has changed on their end. Game is still far to buggy to make it worth playing\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis game was a good concept but the developers just couldn't follow through. As the years have gone on it has just gotten worse and worse. In my opinion, I think the devs got a bit full of themselves when the game started because it was popular (mainly cause people like markiplier played it) and that influenced everything after that.  One of the reasons I think that is because instead of fixing the bugs in the game, that pretty much everyone in the community knew about and had asked to be fixed, they decided to try to push console release when it obviously wasn't ready. The devs are a team of 7 people. That may not sound like a lot, but when it comes to developing a smaller game like phasmophobia that has been out for YEARS, you would expect them to have done more with the game. Or at least fix the issues it currently has.\n\nThis is a list of just some of the problems with phasmophobia:\n1. There is ALWAYS bugs. Some that have been there for YEARS and have not been fixed. If I named every bug I know about that is still currently an issue it would be close to 30-40 bugs. These are issues that the community has told them of time and time again (heck even their partners have told them about them). \n\n2. The devs don't ever listen to the community. Doesn't matter if practically EVERY person asks for it the devs don't ever listen. They don't even listen to the people they are PARTNERED with! Side note: To be a partner of Phasmophobia you have to have multiple months worth of having over 150 viewers every stream on twitch (For reference to become a twitch partner you only need 75 consistent viewers) So the devs want double of what twitch does.\n\n3. The devs making promises that they don't follow through on. *cough* Console release *cough* The amount of times they make timing promises, or even promises on adding things, and don't follow through is insane. I know so many people that have abandoned playing this game just because they are sick of playing a buggy game that never improves because the devs don't want to fix it.\n\n4. Want to create mods to fix issues that the developers obviously won't? Well you're shit outta luck!! If you even attempt to mod phasmophobia you will literally be banned from playing. You can try to open the game but it will not let you play again. Doesn't matter that YOU paid for the game. You want to try to add something to the community? Get the heck outta here! \n\n5. The developers repeatedly saying they won't do something because it would be ""too hard"". For example fixing the ghost hunting sound issues, or fixing the highschool map since its awful. One of my closest friends is a game developer so I've seen first hand how much work goes into fixing bugs. When pretty much everyone is complaining about one of the maps that probably means you should fix it instead of making a  new broken map *cough* Point Hope *cough*. It really wouldn't take that long to fix these issues they just don't want to because they are STILL trying to push console release and don't want to waste their time.\n\nThere are many more problems with this game but I will just leave it at this. This game COULD have been amazing. COULD have. If the devs would get their heads out of their asses maybe they could still salvage this game but I doubt they will. Even if the devs had come out and said ""Hey is there anyone willing to help with fixing the bugs in blah blah blah"" THAT would have shown effort. If you aren't willing to fix very obvious issues let other people that want to fix them do it. The devs have pretty much run this game into the ground for so many people. I know I am one of them.

Like most people I was exposed to this game through over hyped scream streamers a few years back. I didn't decide to splurge on this game until now, and I regret it. \n\nThere is a pointless leveling system that seems to only exist to draw out your play time artificially, like for instance, the fact there's a level 80 upgrade for the flashlight of all things. Apparently this isn't how the game has always been, and it's a new feature that a lot of people seem to not like. Still, I'm not reviewing the Phasmophobia from 3 years ago, I'm reviewing the Phasmophobia you get right now. \n\nThen there's the point to be made this game is actually incredibly boring even with friends. We were walking around repeating the same three cliche ghost hunter phrases for nothing at all to happen. When a ghost finally did appear it just seemed kind of random.\n\nOver that, the game really isn't scary. Every single ghost does the exact same thing. It smears its fingers in your eye balls and drags you off to some ghosty meat room, and then you're dead. Which is a major missed opportunity considering the fact there's literally a ghost with a big ass meat cleaver and it just...does nothing with it???\n\n I mean they take the time to give each of the ghosts at least a mostly unique look, but when it comes down to it, it's just the same NPC with a different skin. Which just makes them dreadfully predictable and drab. Overall, the ""scares"" aren't quiet as offensively dumb as .png jumpscares, but not much better.\n\nI could go on, but I think the most sobering thing about this game is that my friend pointed out people probably just play this game to have something to occupy time. Or more exactly, ""people play this game like I play Destiny 2"". Which is just kinda...disappointing. \n\nI knew this game was never going to be as scary as scream streamers want you to think it is, I mean Christ, these guys probably jump at their own shadows, but I expected at least a half decent horror game and instead got....ghost themed level grind simulator. If they removed the dumb leveling system, or found some better alternative method to keep people around, and if they did more to make the scares...actually scary and less boring, I could see my review changing. But for now, I'd say just let this game slip by. Go play lethal company or something.","1723963081","1723963539","False","0","0","0.476190477609634399","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

Cool.\r\n\r\nIf you make a positive review because you are a casual player who just plays it to be scared and get some money in-game to buy equipment, that’s ok, but say it. “As a casual player, it is a good ‘terror’ game.”\r\n\r\nPhasmo is not a terror game. It is a puzzle game with very few terror aspects. I said “terror,” not horror. It terrifies you, but let’s say terror as a physical aspect and horror as a mental aspect. Phasmo does not have a horror aspect at all. There is no atmosphere, there is no construction. After some time, not 400 hours, way less than this, you discover that this game is RNGs, dice, bugs. All that remains after 100 hours is numbers. A house, ugly and badly designed, which I call “White Squares,” with an Entity rolling dice and giving 0’s or 1’s. Same interactions, same events, same spots, same characters, same items, same sounds. Oh, but you have 400 hours… Yeah, I have 300 hours on some other games and still play them. Those games activate something, adrenaline, fun, something, using the same sounds, atmosphere, characters. Phasmo just gets boring.\r\n\r\nAs a puzzle game, good. Bugged. Banshee closing door, Shade, Yurei, Onryo hunting at 100%, active ghosts doing nothing. Items teleporting outside and inside walls, some items just disappear, ghosts that grab you from behind a wall, ghosts who enter hidden spots (no, it wasn’t Deogen).\r\n\r\nThe game scripts and programming, bad. Totally inconsistent and bugged. Spaghetti.\r\nPuzzle, ok. Good.\r\nHorror and Terror, infinitely bad. Not even close. I’m not talking about jumpscares, things that jump in your face with a loud sound, that’s just a reaction, not terror. Jump Scare is a bad thing, this game doesn’t have them, but also, doesn’t have anything about horror and terror.\r\nImmersion? Not even close.\r\nSounds: Terrifyingly bad. They don’t even know how to implement a new sound without making it sound horrifically implemented. Too loud, not realistic. Sounds are a fault of this game. They break the minimal immersion which this game supposedly has.\r\n\r\nMost of the old players like to play houses and farms, but they are just empty rooms filled with assets that tell you nothing. The game doesn’t tell you anything. There’s no feeling when you enter the house or farmhouse.\r\n\r\nThe hunt. The only thing where this game excels over other games. The hunt has some mechanics. That’s it. No other game has this. They have everything better than Phasmo, but Phasmo has the hunts. Where you can hide, loop the ghosts, keep yourself alive when cornered.\r\n\r\nIf you play Demonologist once and enter the first house, you will know exactly what Phasmo needs to learn.\r\nLast update. New map. To me? Was nothing. Re-skin of a boring game. New map, same bugs, same boring ghosts, same boring events, same boring evidence, bad sound added (clipped sound and not realistic and immersive). Two runs and you want to quit.\r\n\r\nIt rewards you with nothing. Prestige, new cards… Bullshit. Nobody cares about that. Trust me, it means nothing and that’s it.\r\nIf you are casual, go ahead. You don’t aim at being good at the game. Just play at the professional level. Put the equipment, get evidence, and get killed or get your money. Totally recommend it, on sale. Do not give your money to a DEV who doesn’t care about their own game. Look at the updates. Some of them have “nothing.”\r\n\r\nIf you are not casual and want an immersive game, get good at it. Learn. I give you 100 hours to get tired.","1723838169","1723838169","False","3","0","0.479865789413452148","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

After years of hype around it & finally trying it out I’ve found that not only it is the worst game I’ve ever played but, it’s easily the worst designed game I’ve ever played when it comes on onboarding new players. There is no intro, tutorial, or guiding steps for new players. An onboarding process simply doesn’t exist. \n\nFrom what I’ve read online the game, under the hood, apparently is extremely impressive but on the surface the basic player experience is hands down the worse I’ve ever had. No matter how someone wants to defend this game, it always comes back to “you just don’t understand it” and you’re right. I don’t understand it and how can I if the game does absolutely nothing to show me if what I’m doing is right or wrong. \n\nI’m perfectly fine with not having my hand held but that requires feedback from the game. There is no sense of feedback given to you to help you understand mechanics or to hint that you’re doing something right. You have no clue what to look for or how to use some of the items without outside help from something like the wiki or a guide. \n\nThis game seems to require you to either play with very experienced players to essentially hand hold or just tell you what to do OR you need to commit to studying guides & reading the entire wiki just to begin to maybe understand the basics. I feel like I could take a full semester college course on this game and come out knowing the same amount of info compared to having never played it. I understand the essence that the game is going for but in reality, it’s just you being dumped into a level, being give half the puzzle pieces, & being told to finish the puzzle. \n\nPlaying this game is like being sat down at gunpoint in front of all the tools & parts needed to build the International Space Station & being told to just “figure it out”. Playing this game is like being sat down in the cockpit of a full booked commercial airplane, given no guidance on how to fly a plane, & being told everyone’s life is in your hands. Playing this game feels like having both my hands & feed tied together, being thrown in a ring with a world champ boxer, & being told to fight. \n\nHow am I expected to accomplish literally anything. I’m so far removed from understanding even the basic mechanics as a new player that I feel this doesn't even qualify to be called a game. Regardless of the reality of the situation, this game feels like a slot machine when it comes to figuring out what works and what doesn’t. Evidence & interactions feel like random chance. This game is, without question, the worst game I’ve ever played. The most concerning thing of all is how this game has so many overwhelmingly positive reviews.","1723092868","1723094859","False","2","0","0.49127274751663208","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

The radio you have access to perfectly puts this on display.

There has been so many occasions I've had in this game where I would see a moroi moving slow 17 minutes in with no sanity meds, or a thaye that starts slow or even a demon that hunts at the pace of a spirit which can completely throw off attempting to play on modes with reduced evidence. My biggest difficulty with the game (which is a personal opinion and doesn't mean the game would be better or worse overall without) is that they should remove the money from the game but leave in the leveling up system to unlock better levels of equipment. Part of the game is being scared, having a demon hunt the second you enter the house the first time and not being able to find a hiding spot happens, but most times instead of being able to enjoy the spooks I find myself upset that I just lost 2k in equipment because a ghost just decided to walk directly into my hiding spot with nothing on and no mic. It is an almost unbearable grind to get up the money to bring a decent truck of equipment just to be trolled by a friend and murdered. the problem isn't being killed because it's a friend, we all love messing around with each other, but the problem is more knowing how long it's going to take before I can bring stuff in again. I feel that removing money would make it so you can enjoy the messing with friends without sentencing someone or yourself to having to do 5 solo runs to just bring the essentials. I would love to see a wider range of maps, better lighting in the game, more assets or maybe even character customization??? the fact theres like 6 models and we can't even at least change shirt colors or hair really shows the effort put into the personal aspects of the game. Recently Point Hope released and is personally my favorite map next to sunny meadows. It has a unique layout that the other maps do not, unique hiding spots, an extremely fun easter egg and a lot of character in the map itself. It feels more crafted and put together to be a perfect map for ghosthunting as opposed to the houses which just exclusively just feel like downloaded map assets that had no personal change to fit the theme of the game. The concept of this game is incredible, it's revolutionary for the horror genre and basically ushered in the age of proximity chat in co-op horror which is the best but it really does fall short with replayability and overall enjoyment after even 50 hours of playing. still fun to rarely play when you have a lot of friends to hop on with.","1721904226","1721904226","False","0","0","0","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

I recently had a bug where a ghost that is only meant to hunt at 50% sanity hunted me at 83% sanity - in solo mode, so no, it wasn't an 'average sanity' thing. I recently started playing other ghost hunting'games and seeing how other dev teams implemented minor improvements to make a huge impact on the gameplay really pushed me away from Phas.

There's a fear factor bundled with a learning curve that challenges you to learn about each ghost, cursed object, different tricks to achieve perfect runs, etc. Once that's mastered, you're only option left is to up the difficulty with custom matches, which will play on your capability to think quickly and react accordingly. This can help revitalize the game, but only for so long. With a group of friends it can be interesting, but that's dependent on them wanting to play just as much.\n\nThe online multiplayer is a revolving door of toxicity. From trolls, to people exploiting glitches left unpatched for months, to insane female ""gamers"" trying to dictate lobbies, players who refuse to use a mic, and lets not forget all of the hard asses that essentially end up doing all the work. I'm excluding new people because you cannot blame someone for not knowing how to play a game they're new at, but be prepared to have to teach them as well once you're familiar with it.\n\nAbout those glitches? There are several well-known glitches that have been in this game for well over a year. The built-in voice chat audio system alone is enough to drive you insane (spoiler: it doesn't work). I find myself often talking to myself in most matches because the audio breaks, but only one way. While everyone else can hear me the entire time, I'm unable to hear them. This is not an audio issue on my end. The game audio still works, as well as local voice chat. The radio is what is broken. I reported this amongst several other issues in the official Discord server, and it was deleted less than a day later. I asked about it and was quickly brushed off as it already being known. This issue has been occurring for over a year, and I know I'm not the only one with it. Blocking single players ends up blocking your friends as well. The bone straight up does not spawn some matches. Ghosts don't adhere to their appropriate definitions (as in a Deogen full on tanking through players without ever slowing down).

But alas, here we are. I've been playing this game on and off for a number of years. It was good for so long. And as they started to make more changes, they started making the user/player experience worse and worse. \nI was never a huge fan of the stamina, but they have nerfed your stamina so bad that you can't even run for 3 seconds without running out of breathe. The voice comms are weird and buggy, and inconsistent. And the proximity chat is so much worse than it used to be.\nThen there's the shop. They've gone through numerous iterations of the shop, and seemingly only making it worse and more confusing as they update it. I guess the most current one is okay at best. But definitely not user friendly for new players(or those that are new to this shop.)\nThen there's the unlocking of better items, which I think is a really cool aspect, however you have to pay to unlock those items. Which, honestly, is annoying as well, though I can see why they'd do that. \n\nThey've killed my joy for this game. I used to be able to play this games for hours at a time, and all I just want to quit after at most 2 or 3 runs. Overall extremely disappointed in what they've done to this game. And honestly, even if I hadn't played this game before, I would be so put off by the shop alone that I would have been upset at spending money on this game.\n\nI also just remembered how bad the visibility is. I struggle with games that are too dark because my vision isn't great. And they made it so impossibly dark that it's so hard to see. With no options of making it brighter. This current iteration of the game is extremely disappointing as a long time fan.","1721353760","1721354164","False","0","0","0","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

It's not uncommon for items to show no evidence of a certain kind of ghost even if that is the ghost type at large, despite my group's best effort to painstakingly use/place the gear in the ghost room or around the haunted location.

I am one hour away from 200 hours in this game. We took a large break after the progression update and stopped playing for a while but we got bored of the games in our circulation and ended up coming back a month or two ago.\n\nIf I'm being honest, I don't think this game is worth buying in this state. It's 20 usd but even being so cheap, it's just horrible to play. The game is in an extremely buggy state, making it incredibly frustrating to just get through one round. We are constantly battling with the bugs, the horrible ghost AI and much more. Even with us only sticking to the smaller maps, it's still unpleasant but tolerable. We can't play on the bigger maps because it's impossible to find the ghost before it starts hunting, even with the three of us. This means we can't play half of the maps. This week's challenge is Audio Only in Sunny Meadows. Sunny Meadows has a very large number of ambient noises that sound like ghost interactions or ghost events. It's pretty much a troll. ""You have to find the ghost through noise, but oh... yea not that noise or that noise, none of those are the ghost.""\n\nThe bugs are just too prominent to comfortably play. You're constantly second guessing yourself on what the ghost is actually doing because of both the bugs and the horrible ghost AI. It feels like 70% of the time, the ghost will hunt from outside the ghost's room. For example, we were playing the other night. The ghost evented on us and my friend took a picture right at the end of the event. It counted as a three star ghost photo but the ghost wasn't in the photo. We assumed it was a phantom and then when we got orbs, a mimc. Then we got DOTS and realized it was neither.\n\nIt's hard to be patient when it's the same bugs, the same issues, since I've been playing. How many perfect hunts have been ruined because the photo system sucks? The ghost is right in front of your face but it's a one star salt photo.\n\nI do like the core gameplay. I like the variety in ghosts and maps. I like the different ghost abilities. It's just having to navigate the game that makes it really unenjoyable. It's not just the bugs. It's also the very limited stamina. Other than a couple of ghosts, they're always faster than you. Surely, in a game like this, you would want to give the players enough stamina to escape, but you can only take two running steps before your character is out of breath. I'm disabled and bedridden most days but even I can sprint more than that. The other mechanic I loathe is the shop. It recently got an update and somehow it made it even worse to navigate.\n\nThe recent post on steam claims the update coming for Halloween will be about bug fixes and optimisation so if the new update comes out and the game changes, I'll change my review again.","1721177855","1729291131","False","0","0","0","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

This game fundamentally doesn't work without items. Half the objectives aren't doable while leveling because you haven't reached a high enough level to have access the items required to complete them. Half the ghosts you can't figure out without a smudge stick, or salt, or gods even just a decent dots system. The progressions rework effectively feels like a ""nerf"" at first(tier 1 items, not having access to half the items in the game, etc...), which you then have to spend hours grinding away at in order to get the game back to the state it used to be in (tier 2 items), before finally becoming something new and interesting once you've sunk a bunch of time into grinding out boring and uninteresting games. I'm sure the people with thousands of hours in this game who know every exploit and way to cheat the system find the challenge rewarding, but it sucks that you cant just opt out of it.

That sounds great and all from a developer standpoint for players to put more hours in but from a player viewpoint not so much.\n\nMe and my friends que back into this game to see that we are all at level 1 and the worst part is, we got nothing. The basic starter items make the game even worst. If you die, you get no money and it takes so much money to even get better items, but wait. You won't be able to even buy it because you're level 10 and you need level 30 or something. The basic item are so hard to read and sometimes the killer is right next to me and it wouldn't even go off because it's a low tier tool. How can we play the game? We don't. It really is not enjoyable to have 1 flashlight on a team of 4 and an EMF reader that doesn't even beep. It's truly just not enjoyable to go into a haunted house with nothing. \n\nThis game was really fun at some point but now, it's like i guess i have to be an absolute pro and play this game solo for a year to have enough points and money to buy equipment.

I am skeptical to if the game will fully release at all, and if it does, any of the glaring issues this game has had since launch will remain around. It's been four years and the game is still using unity assets, still has the same terrible looking player models, and the core gameplay still remains largely unaltered from release. The excuse has always been that this game has been ""early access"", but the developers keep releasing content updates with little or no changes to these problems. Not to mention the countless bugs that plague this game, but hey we got a cool new map so that's pretty cool right?\r\n\r\nIf Kinetic games gets their stuff together and focuses on fixing these issues then I would 100% recommend this game.

So I've watched this game from a very early state to exactly where it is now. \n\nI cannot recommend this unbearably misguided game to any horror fans. DK, lead dev of the project, has been one of the least communicative indie devs I have ever seen, to the point I feel Blizzard is a better communicator than him. Not to help, time and time again he has made the absolute least cool decisions possible regarding the future of the game. What once was a game that focused on its horror and took control away from the player in clever ways, we now have a game-ified, pseudo competitively balanced time trial simulator. The game used to encourage different styles of play, so long as you didn't die and tried to stay alive. But now, the game is laser focused on you knowing all the most random trivia about each ghost to be able to tell what it is, and immediately GTFO for that money per minute ratio. It is now IMPOSSIBLY DENSE for new players and most non horror fans will simply put it down before long. And as a diehard horror fan, that makes me terribly sad. When the game gives you more of a headache than it does scare you.\n\nBack to DK, it's surprising how much drama this game has managed to strike up within its own community time and time again. Whether it's having a STRICT policy about uploading glitches, then not punishing Youtubers under your own strict policy when they abuse a bug to play content early, but permit it until some crybaby dude has to call y'all out on it, and THEN you change your mind about it being okay under the table. Or maybe the worst part. \n\nNo. Modding. Allowed. \n\nYep, you're going to play this unity game the exact way DK wants you to, bro HATES modding. Which is wild. There's a reason why no one plays this game anymore on YT, and why even in July, people still get hilarious or horrifying clips of Lethal. Any anti-modding dev is what's known in kid lingo as ""ultra-cringe."" Bro it's not that serious, do you know how much healthier this game would be if you didn't go to war with modders in the background? Maybe they'd be able to actually give us some maps that don't take 2 years to develop (Hello Point Hope). The release of content is so painfully slow, you'd think they were still developing games with a PS2 devkit. But this is all in Unity. The release of content is way too painfully slow to be any kind of sustainable. It wasn't always this way!! We used to get decently fast releases, at a pretty respectable pace for a solo dev! But now....Point Hope, huh? What was that reveal, Halloween 2022? That's insanity.\n\nLethal Company does EVERYTHING and then WAY more than Phasmo does. I strongly do not recommend you spend your time here. I haven't even mentioned the atrociously grindy leveling system that demands hyper maxing your EXP gains just to unlock OP equipment that trivializes the actual ghost hunting aspects of the y'know GHOST HUNTING GAME. Hopefully someone else visits this concept again one day and can do a better job. But at least I can downgrade to a better version of the game still and enjoy it that way. In its cute, flawed af, but much better state.\n\nI do not recommend you play this. Sincerely, a once passionate fan and giant horror nerd.","1720462593","1720462593","False","6","2","0.516120553016662598","0","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""

It's hardly even scary since you know you're most likely going to die anyway, but it is quite immersive so they got that right. On the other hand, being immersive means the graphics are super high, so a chunk of my play time is just waiting on loading screens and it always takes me the longest to load into multiplayer matches. Another thing about multiplayer - when you die you sometimes have to wait 30 minutes for the round to end! Also the harder modes are only playable if you've spent hours reading on the wiki to get a small hint at what the ghost could be if you can't find all 3 clues. Basically don't play the game if you don't like a LOT of waiting and an overall boring experience.","1720389252","1720389252","False","0","3","0.445705026388168335","1","True","False","True","False","","","","","","",""
