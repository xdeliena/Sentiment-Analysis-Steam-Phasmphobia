76561199081200603,"I used to be really afraid of this game, but it's not that bad. I love it.",good
76561198347415253,"My most played game on Steam. \n\nAn incredibly addicting game, if not a simple one. \n\nThe good: Mechanics are solid and easy to grasp, low skill floor, high skill ceiling. Genuinely scary starting off, but with a minimal amount of playtime it becomes less so, transitioning to a puzzle game rather than a horror one. Can still catch you unawares, though, which is nice. Play it alone and it can be terrifying. Absolutely a riot with friends, as you can both get things done, or mess with them and laugh at their untimely paranormal deaths. \n\nThe bad: Gameplay loop can be repetitive, even monotonous at times. Scares can get stale, and eventually the game seems to lose its luster and challenge. Lacking in some diversity of maps, lower tier equipment can be frustrating and not as intuitive to use. Updates are infrequent.\n\nThe ugly: Mostly bugs. Not many gamebreaking ones, but some allow you to noclip into certain spots. Sometimes ghosts will behave incorrectly, or not show evidences they're supposed to. Hackers exist, though are incredibly rare to see. Most will be annoying at most. \n\nOverall, I think Phasmophobia is an excellent game that is well worth its value. It can still provide some scares and can be incredibly mentally engaging, though these effects can wane with time. Up to you to keep your experience fresh. I recommend it played with friends, and that you challenge yourself to do risky things and have fun with it rather than take it completely serious if you want the best experience.",good

76561199663364215,Playing the game with friends is a lot of fun but will also make you scream.\r\n\r\nPlaying solo in the dark is some of the scariest game I have played.\r\nLove it,good

76561199474564461,"Great game, very fun to play with friends. However, I will say that it is pretty difficult to get that sweet gear in tier 3. It takes a lot of time, but that time is worth it in the end. In conclusion, this game is well worth the price tag of 15$, and is definitely worth checking out. 9.5/10, will play again.

76561199090564713,"its peak, i genuinely cant say a legitimate negative thing about it. you get in there and hunt ghosts, playing with lower evidence lets your brain work and every contract you learn something from it. of course, its best with friends, i have 40 hours and have yet to play solo and probably never will (probably cuz im a lil b*tch but hey) cuz whenever im the last one standing, the horror sets in, no more funnies and sillies.\n\nif you like horror games, get it. even if youre not the biggest horror fan, if you have some friends who play, play with them and it'll be way less scary.\n\nhappy ghost hunting my friends",good

Enjoy games where you can work alongside and/or troll your friends? Phasmophobia is the game for you (and your friends)! \n\nBoasting a wide variety of maps and challenges, Phasmophobia is perfect for any type of play style. For more casual players, it's easy to set up a beginner/intermediate contract and knock em out fairly easily without having to stress about the ghost hunting right away. Feeling up for a challenge? Phasmophobia also offers an array of fun yet difficult gamemodes that'll put your ghost hunting skills to the test! Whether it be special weekly contracts, the 3 trophy challenges, or even the nightmare/insanity gamemodes, Phasmophobia has a little bit of everything to really spice up your gameplay!",good

76561198148149574,"There are so many hidden aspects to this game that you don't see upfront. This game is definitely a hyper fixation game for me and I've gotten so many of my friends to play it. It's so much more than ""figure out the ghost"". The cursed objects, getting pictures, hearing where sounds are coming from, all the way down to staring the ghost in the face as it's trying to kill you, but it can't, behind you are on the other side of the kitchen island. \n\nHighly recommend with friends, but be warned this definitely can be a friendship test. 100000/10",good

76561198051020230,"Phasmophobia is not just your average survival horror genre game, it is a game that makes you have to think on everything you do.  Identifying the ghost type takes a lot of time on some hunts, going off of more than just the evidence provided, having to memorize behavior patterns, movement speeds, and even hunting styles.  An amazing and fantastic game with jump scares galore, a definite top tier game!",good

76561199681348824,"Let me just say, this game has blown me away. I always wanted to play this game, however I just recently got my PC and got this and its even more fun than I ever imagined. I will say it is more enjoyable with friends, but can be contently played solo as well. VR makes it even more incredible. I already almost have 100 hours in this game and have barely owned it a month. My friends are the same way, and we play it almost every night before we hop off, sometimes all night. \r\n\r\nMy second biggest praise in regards to this game are how active the devs are in listening to the community they have developed. They are active on all socials and constantly evolving the game with fun and interactive challenges, new updates, and more. \r\n\r\nI will say the game can become a bit mundane after like level 60 or so, simply because you start to learn ghost behaviors and signs. Good news is there is a simple fix, do custom mode and make it harder, prestige and reset all equipment, set personal goals, the game truly never gets ""old"". We just get more experienced. \r\n\r\nOverall I would absolutely recommend this game to one and all, Happy hunting!",good

I always thought I would be too scared to actually play horror games and have always just watched others, but I took a leap for the new year in trying out Phasmophobia and I'm glad I did because even though I'm terrified, this game is ADDICTING.",good

76561199437916436,"This game is amazing but its got pros and cons. Lets start with the pros. Firstly this game targets creativity, teamwork and critical thinking. Secondly, Phasmophobia allows the players to have fun with their friends and ofc learn about ghosts. Now lets go to the cons, shall we? firstly, most people who play this game become addicted since it is so fun and addictive for people. Secondly, this game has some game modes which contain cursed objects, such as monkey paw (works when we wish), the mirror (shows the ghost room), the music box (starts off and there a cursed hunt begins), the tarrot cards (we pull out cards that interract with the future of the game) and lastly the SuMmOnInG CyRcLe ( we light up the candles and a cursed hunt begins). All in all, I believe that this game is amazing with its features, its a unique and fun game to play with friends and family.",good

They retreat to the entrance of the house, and start chanting the ghosts name like some sort of ritual.\r\n3. You, being completely unaware of this, keep exploring the house, trying to find the room.\r\n4. You find it, only to have the ghost kill you in a hunt, as it doesn't like having it's name called out frequently.\r\n5. You walk over to your ""friends"" laughing realising you've died to what they've done.\r\n6. You take the knowledge and information you've gathered, and correctly assume what type of ghost it is.\r\n7. Sit back and relax, roaming around, and watching everyone else fumble around trying to receive the same information you've successfully gathered.\r\n8. Sadly, and I am hesitant to admit, but repeat the past steps.",good

76561199134316886,"Phasmophobia, developed by Kinetic Games, is a cooperative multiplayer horror game that puts players in the role of ghost hunters investigating haunted locations. Since its release in 2020, it has gained widespread popularity for its immersive and terrifying gameplay.\r\n\r\nThe core of Phasmophobia is its cooperative gameplay. Players use a variety of tools?ike EMF readers, spirit boxes, and thermometers?o gather evidence of paranormal activity in different locations. The goal is to identify the type of ghost haunting the building. Players must work together, exploring dark and ominous spaces while avoiding the ghost? attacks. The game? unpredictable nature keeps every session fresh, with unique ghost behaviors and communication methods.\r\n\r\nThe game? atmosphere is its biggest strength. The eerie environments, from dark houses to creepy asylums, are designed to make players feel tense. The sound design enhances this experience, with creaking doors, footsteps, and ghostly whispers creating constant dread. Phasmophobia stands out by allowing players to communicate with the ghost through a voice recognition system, which adds an unsettling layer of interaction.\r\n\r\nUnlike games that rely on jump scares, Phasmophobia builds fear through psychological tension. As players gather evidence, the ghost becomes more active, and the sense of dread grows. The game tracks players' fear levels, and when they drop too low, the ghost becomes hostile. Permadeath adds to the stakes?f you're caught by the ghost, you're out of the game, heightening the suspense and fear.\r\n\r\nPhasmophobia thrives on teamwork. The best moments come from coordinating with friends to gather evidence or outsmart the ghost. Communication is key, and the proximity-based voice chat makes the experience more immersive. The game can be frustrating with random players, but playing with friends makes it a thrilling, unforgettable experience.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Phasmophobia is an outstanding horror game that blends suspense, cooperative gameplay, and psychological terror. Its unpredictable nature and immersive atmosphere make it a must-play for horror fans. If you enjoy games that get under your skin and keep you on edge, Phasmophobia is a must-try?ust be prepared for some real scares!",good

This game has lots of ghosts you can try and find while at the same time you're trying to survive. There is about 20+ ghosts you can hunt and find. These ghosts all behave differently so you can an interesting experience. There is also a multiplayer feature in this game. You can join online lobbies with random people of different levels. You can also join private lobbies to play with your friends just by yourself. There is also a single-player option in this game. In the single-player mode you can play by yourself and try to find the ghost while being its only target, hence the name.

Its a blast if you play with people that haven't  really played because there's a lot of super sweats in this game and it doesn't even make the game fun at that point.

76561199739694561,"I went into Phasmophobia thinking I was ready to face some ghostsI was wrong. So very wrong.\n\nFirst off, the ghosts? Absolutely terrifying. The sound of footsteps when no one? around, the cold breath on your neck, and the way they make the lights flicker? You?l never look at a dark hallway the same way again. But here's the twist: while you?e running for your life, your friends are probably screaming louder than you, making you laugh even though your heart is in your throat.\n\nLet? talk about the equipment. You've got EMF readers, spirit boxes, and a UV flashlight, but somehow the real ghost is your own sanity. The moment you see the ghost? shadow and your sanity drops to 0%, you know it? not just the ghost that? about to kill you it? your best friend who just locked you in the room with it.\n\nThe best part? Watching your friend scream and then immediately pretend they weren? scared once they?e safely outside. ""I wasn't scared, I knew you were fine in there!"" Yeah, sure, Karen, keep telling yourself that while I? over here with a ghost standing behind me.\n\nIn short, Phasmophobia is like a haunted house but with better graphics, a terrifying soundtrack, and the added bonus of being completely unable to trust your teammates when things go south. Would recommend if you enjoy heart-pounding terror mixed with uncontrollable laughter and near-death experiences with friends you?l probably never trust again. 10/10 would scream with friends again.",good

When I got to the ""Are you friendly?"" question I thought I got no response, until clear as day I hear ""LETS HUNT!""

76561198189893078,"I have played both the early and current versions of Phasmophobia, and can definitely say that the developers have given a lot of love and care to this game over the years. The difficulty, progression, learning curve, and captivation have all been vastly improved while maintaining the staple 'rawness' of the game. The current state of the game is the best it has ever been.\r\nThere are plenty of features to keep you excited about the game: multiple unlocked tiers for each item, custom difficulties and challenges such as apocalypse, in-game events, many different ghosts with vastly different behaviors, and plenty of locations to choose from. Each game is a different experience, and I really appreciate the variety that has been added to the game.\r\nWhere the game really shines is in multiplayer. Working together as a semi-functional team facing your fears together in a world with an interesting physics system couldn't be more fun. The ability to interact with your dead friends adds a lot of hilarious depth to the game if used correctly, and the ability to get them killed is even funnier. This game is meant to be played in a team environment, especially if you don't take it too seriously.  \r\nMy only major gripe with the game is the grindiness to upgrade the items and to unlock each achievement. For reference, I have nearly 40ish hours of meaningful gameplay in the new update, where I started at level 1. I am only level 80 and need to get to level 100 for just one of the two prestiges I need to 100% the game. Specifically those achievements add no real substance to the game, just a grind. Granted, I wasn't all the way efficient in my gameplay when it comes to leveling up and actually living, but needing 40+ hours as an inexperienced player to have not even unlocked the full loadout is insane. \r\nI love this game and have done every achievement thus far besides the grindy ones. I would definitely recommend this game, but I don't fully recommend trying to unlock every achievement or even trying to unlock the full loadout unless you really love Phasmophobia. \r\n",good
76561198095723404,"Honestly, going into this game completely blind in 2024 definitely made it hard to grasp at first. However, after watching Youtube/Twitch videos and stumbling across this hilarious and insightful community I quickly fell in love with the adrenaline of finding evidence, taking pictures and successfully identifying what ghost is haunting!!! I'm really loving playing Phasma with my friends, reviewing our new discoveries and getting better and better (and braver) to progress to more challenging play styles! I cannot believe I didn't give this game a go sooner!",good

76561198886201972,"[b] 1. The Ghost Hates Board Games: [/b]\nDon? even think about breaking out the Ouija board for some spirited communication. The ghost doesn? just dislike board games; it actively punishes you for playing them. Forget Scrabble?his is more like ?udden Death Bingo,and the ghost is really competitive.\n\n[b] 2. No Friends Allowed:  [/b]\nPhasmophobia? ghosts are the epitome of anti-social. Bring a group of pals to share some laughs, and the ghost immediately decides you?e too happy. It? like it can sense joy and says, ?ope, time to ruin this.Bonus points if it starts hunting just as you get comfortable?t? the ghostly equivalent of slamming the door in your face.\n\n[b] 3. Karaoke Night = Nightmare Night:  [/b]\nWant to spice up your investigation with a little sing-along? Think again. Whether you belt out ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" or hum a lullaby, the ghost is not a fan. Every note is like nails on its ectoplasmic chalkboard. Honestly, it? the Simon Cowell of the afterlife.\n\n[b] 4. Tarot Cards Are the Real MVP:  [/b]\nThe only thing the ghost seems to love as much as scaring you senseless is tarot cards. These little gems are like ghostly loot boxes, and the chaos they bring? Chef? kiss. The cards might revive your friend, summon instant death, or just make the ghost angrier?ind of like the ghost equivalent of an espresso shot.\n\n[b] Verdict:  [/b]\nPhasmophobia is a fantastic game if you enjoy being terrorized by a sulking, melodramatic spirit that can? stand fun or group activities. It? like the ultimate haunted house party where the host doesn? want anyone to party. 10/10 would get yelled at for singing again.",good

My friend stood by the door behind me, and as soon as I stepped foot inside the building, the door slammed shut, and the ghost immediately began its hunt.\n\nThe screams grew louder, and my heart beats were at an all time high as if I was in the middle of an intense cardio workout. The lights flickered, and I heard footsteps and eerie noises coming from down the hallway.\n\nI held a crucifix in my hand, shouting, ""The power of Christ compels you!"" but it had no effect on the ghost. Desperate, I tried hiding in a tool cupboard, which seemed like a good idea at the time. Unfortunately, it turned out to be pointless, as the ghost was a Deogen. A ghost that can sense the living and cannot be hidden from, though we didn't have enough evidence to know this as the time.\n\nMeanwhile, my friend stood outside, watching through the window, laughing as the ghost grabbed my neck and killed me.
