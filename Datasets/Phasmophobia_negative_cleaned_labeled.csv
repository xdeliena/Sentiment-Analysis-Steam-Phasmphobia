76561198872156581,"It’s not very good lol. I feel like this is one of those Steam games everyone owns, but if you can help it, I wouldn’t get it. When you break it down, so much of Phasmophobia is just spent waiting and when not waiting, walking around slowly from point A to B. The only good qualities about this game is that it’s multiplayer with proximity chat which is a fun combination and that deciphering the ghost type can be fun in a detective kind of way. \n\nThat’s really about it though, the game doesn’t even have good presentation going for it. I mean it looks okay, I guess, but it’s just so stiff and amateurish, it’s the absolute bare minimum is my point. Overall, it’s an okay game, I guess. It’s fun enough, but only because multiplayer games, especially ones that have proximity chat, are just inherently fun in my opinion. Yeah, not great, basically any other multiplayer game would be more fun.",bad
76561198032998391,"I gave this game a fair shake, but it suffers from insanely poor game design.\r\n\r\nI've been playing for two days , not guessed anything even remotely right, to the point where we know the evidence points this way or that but we know we're wrong ahead of time, 0% success. ( I know I know, git gud....)\r\n\r\nThe game suffers from serious jank, I could forgive the poor graphics if things worked smoothly or at all , if placing things wasn't so much time wasting guess work, I kind of hate that they went ahead with the VR version of the game without polishing the standard version at all. like having dessert before dinner if you ask me.\r\n\r\nAll of the ghosts look more or less the same, There's like twenty different kinds all with overlapping evidence profiles, so guessing is a complete crapshoot. \r\n\r\nhow the various evidence gathering tools work is just terrible. half the time the correct answer will have required EMF lvl 5 or something and you swept the whole house with it , and were right next to the ghost with the meter out while it killed your friend and it still didn't register. This game is so inconsistent it makes my head spin. \r\n\r\nI've never said the words ""I hate this stupid game"" quite this much or with this much conviction.\r\n\r\ncool idea, generates great tension, terrible design and implementation. I wish I didn't have to say this, but this game genuinely sucks.\r\n\r\ncannot recommend.",bad

76561198010567074,"Game is almost unplayable. There are too many ghost types for one and that'd be okay except evidence does not work correctly. Voice box does not recognize half the time, Crucifixes don't properly stop ghost hunts, the level system and equipment requirements are ridiculous. You'd have to play the game every day for 8 hours a day to get the level requirement to use any equipment that's worth a damn. The game just straight up does not work and instead of fixing it they just add more and more broken things to it. Also the equipment menu is garbage.. and that's after like 2 complete overhauls of it. The creative direction of this game is failing and all these new ghost hunting games are going to surpass this one because of development speed and testing.",bad

There's plenty of great ideas to be found here, but they instead prioritise new shaders over fully fleshing out/expanding on said ideas. Something as simple as the core gameplay loop still hasn't been given enough meat to be enjoyable outside of co-op experiences that are a credit to ones company rather than the game itself. \n\nInsult to injury, the developers sit on top of a plethora of broken promises while simultaneously failing to be innovative with the game for years despite its popularity.

76561198194571557,Game is fun. problem is that it has too many bugs to recommend. sometimes lobbies only show 1 name for ex if theres 65 lobbies they will all show some discord name or some twitch streaming losers name (probably hacking tbh). i also logged in one day and i couldnt hear or see anything the game had magically altered all of my settings so i went through all the troubleshooting steps just to get reset from level 50 to level 1 after 4 days of grinding all of that out and now i cant get any of my progress back. so no i dont recommend until the devs can fix these issues. other than that there's barely any issues with gameplay other than some ghosts not showing evidence when they should even after being in lobby for over 40 mins.,bad
76561198938601909,"As soon as you figure out how this game works, it ceases to be fun. I've played it with two different groups, both of which had wikis open on their 2nd monitors and were just speedrunning missions. I pretty much just sat there while they figured everything out in about 5 minutes. But the game is also basically impossible to play by yourself. So unless you find 3 other people to play with who also don't know how to play and you ONLY play it with them and they ONLY play it with you so that everyone is learning the game at the exact same pace. I want to say this isn't a design issue, but it... kinda is.\r\nPart of what makes the idea of ghost hunting fun is the element of the unknown and this game just... doesn't really have that anymore. I know that can also just be blamed on the internet and its insatiable need to dissect literally everything under the sun until literally nothing is a mystery anymore. But I feel like there are a few different ways they could remedy this. Requiring more than 3 pieces of evidence to determine a ghost type would be a good start. It would also be nice if pieces of evidence were less conclusive or consistent. Or, something I legitimately can't believe isn't already in the game: Objectives besides identifying and banishing the ghost. Finding a way to communicate with the ghost to get information would be so cool, whether that's figuring out how they died, who killed them, or literally anything along those lines.\r\nLiterally anything to make the game more complex than 1. Find ghost room. 2. Throw EVERY piece of equipment you have into ghost room. 3. Level complete.\r\nThe one way I was able to have fun in this game was by having my more experienced friends sit in a discord call and walk me through what to do. Unfortunately I also have to play the game with no audio because the low bass tone that plays the entire time you're in the house actively makes me feel sick.",bad

You cannot filter or select teams to join based on level and as a new player you will be kicked again and again and again from lobbies because your level is too low and people don't want a 'noob' on their team. \r\n\r\nKicking players is a single click so you will be kicked without warning almost instantly. Once kicked you have to go through a 30s-1min process of rejoining multiplayer and finding the next lobby which will also likely kick you. It is very frustrating and creates a toxic experience. The host of a multiplayer game also cannot switch their hosted game from public to private, cannot directly invite their friends, and cannot reserve a spot for friends. The only way to hold a space for a friend is to keep kicking any player that joins until their friend does.\r\n\r\nThe player base is also unusually toxic and elitist. Because the game was in early access for so long there are a lot of players with years of experience, and a lot of higher level players are intolerant of new players and any mistakes (regardless of your level) are met with an instant kick.\r\n\r\nGriefing is also pretty common - people create game lobbies and never start a game just wasting your time, and there are a lot of ways trolls can join a game and grief the team by hiding items or activating cursed items and killing their team.\r\n\r\nReddit and Discord are full of these same complaints day after day but the Devs have not addressed the issues despite years of complaints.\r\n\r\nI absolutely would not recommend this game to anyone that is not already part of a friend group that plays. Trying to find multiplayer teams is just too toxic and too much hassle and is simply not worth it and single player mode is too hard at higher difficulties by yourself.",bad

76561198864132763,"I genuinely have no idea how Phasmophobia pulled in $500 million. I really don’t. This game is a dumpster fire, and if you’re considering buying it, just don’t. The amount of money this game has made since 2020 is absolutely insane, especially when you realize it’s still as broken and unfinished as it was on launch day. If you’ve got $20 to burn, throw it in the trash—it’s about the same experience.\n\nFirst, the ghost AI is a joke. Half the time, the ghosts are more like clumsy NPCs from a 90s horror game than the terrifying entities they’re supposed to be. One minute they’re hunting you, and the next they’re stuck behind a door or walking in circles like they’ve never seen a human before. There’s no tension. No real fear. Just a lot of waiting for a ghost to either teleport on top of you for no reason or wander aimlessly like it’s lost in the afterlife.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the voice recognition system. What a joke that is. The game acts like you’re supposed to be able to communicate with the ghost, but good luck getting it to even understand you. I’ve tried yelling, speaking slowly, and using different microphones, but the game either completely ignores me or somehow picks up half of what I said and misinterprets it like it was designed by a drunk toddler. Honestly, if I wanted to scream at something and get nothing back, I’d just yell at a wall.\n\nBut the worst part? The multiplayer. If you thought matchmaking was bad, you’re in for a treat. You’ll get kicked out of every single lobby. I’m not kidding. Every. Single. One. It’s not even about your connection—just the game’s absurdly broken mechanics. And once you finally get in a match, you’re stuck with trolls, cheaters, and people who are too busy throwing everything in the van or breaking the game just to mess with you. I’ve played with kids who think it’s funny to ruin everyone’s game, and guess what? The devs couldn’t care less. There’s no way to report them, no way to get rid of them. They’ve made millions and clearly don’t give a damn.\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on the grind. If you want to unlock all the upgrades needed to tackle the higher difficulties, you have to hit level 90. And let me tell you, that’s not something you’re going to achieve easily. You’re stuck doing the same repetitive tasks over and over again, grinding your way to that level, and by the time you get there, you’ll probably be so sick of the game that you won’t even care about the upgrades anymore. The grind is soul-crushing, and honestly, it’s just padding for a game that’s already lacking in content.\n\nLet’s talk content. Spoiler alert: it’s the same damn thing every time. The maps are repetitive, the ghosts are forgettable, and the objectives feel like busy work. After a few rounds, you’ve seen it all. You’re just mindlessly grinding, and the worst part? It’s been this way since launch. The game hasn’t meaningfully evolved at all since 2020. All that money? Gone. To whatever, because it definitely didn’t go into fixing or expanding the game.\n\nGraphics? Don’t even bother. This game looks like it was made in 2005, and it plays like it, too. The frame rate is garbage, it crashes for no reason, and the optimization is beyond terrible. This game can barely run on a decent machine, and somehow it’s still getting praise. If it wasn’t for the spooky “ghosts” walking around, you’d think you were playing a game from a decade ago.\n\nAnd the devs? They’ve taken the money and run. There’s barely any updates, and when they do release something, it’s always half-baked. The bugs that have existed for years are still there, and any potential new content just feels like a quick cash grab. It’s clear they stopped caring once they saw how much they could make.\n\nDo yourself a favor and save your money. There are way better horror games out there that actually work, are fun, and don’t waste your time. This game is a scam, and if you’re foolish enough to buy it, you’ll quickly realize you’ve been had. It’s frustrating, broken, and a complete waste of time. Seriously, just don’t.",bad

Room was living room and it turned out to be a Demon who killed me almost immediately after the initial grace period total of 5:38 seconds on the map and only had 6 sanity lost. Did find the room but found no evidence as by time I found the proper room time was just about up and there was little interaction till it decided to hunt.\n\nSo chalked it up to bad luck and tried again, Found the room earlier this time Laundry room and started focus there, getting lots of door touches and some closing but by time I got the UV there and other stuff it slowed down. By this time my grace is up and now the events are happening elsewhere in the corridor connecting the two kids rooms and bathroom...\n\nSo my starting experiance consists of just killing me for not immediately knowing what it was and deciding it's not enough difficulty trying to figure out what ghost it is with only the starting equipment gotta make it your chasing the ghost around to see if you can get the evidence.\n\nIf your into knowing everything about the game before you start or just like hard games that throw you into the deep end and expect you to figure it out with trial an error this might be for you playing single player.\n\nIf you like being taught through the game itself this is not it as single player.\n\nAs to why I don't play multiplayer, I find most multiplayer games have a good chance of having to deal with toxic players who expect you to be exceptional, at least in random lobbies. I also don't like ether dragging others down while I learn or just have them do the work so fast I don't get a chance to learn for myself.\n\nIMO there should be a currated map for new players that still has randomness to it but limits some of the trickier aspects, such as getting killed almost immediately by a demon, or letting it be one of the hardest rooms to identify due to the limited interactions, or not having the ghost be very active in multiple rooms/ changing rooms.\n\nNot asking for a give me as a first assignment, only something that let's you digest a smaller amount of what this game has in terms of the mechanics.\nRight now it's like telling a kid he has to eat a whole 10lb turkey as the first thing.\n\nYes I did the tutorial... It was something, learned very little from it and frankly it made little sense what it wanted from you. For example the UV part it tells you that you can charge the print... exempt it only accepts the single one on the exit door despite there being multiple ones. Is that actually relevent or just some bs restriction for the purpose of the tutorial, no f'n clue.\n\nBit of advice as well to the Dev team, the thermometer should not be that hard to read when the player is holding. Why am I having to swing around the room to find the one spot where the light is not glaring off it or not lighting it despite my flashlight / torch being on.

The evidence types have remained the same since launch (No secondary evidence doesn't count, I am talking about Primary evidence.)\n\n[h3] Performance [h3] The game has decent graphics yet even on high-end systems will underperform having occasional massive amounts of frame drops.\n\n[h3] Delays [h3] The delays are awful, ever since 2021 Horror 2.0 was promised to be released yet it never happened. It’s been promised to come out each year yet always results in a delay, at this point they should stop teasing Horror 2.0 unless it’s not getting delayed again like always.

I've been playing Phas for almost three years not, and up until this past year it was great. Fun gameplay, great holiday events, consistent updates or ideas for fresh gameplay, the developers were pretty active- A great game! Now to me-its almost anything but. If you're a new player, I might suggest it. The thrill of being new would last you a bit of time. The lack of updates and transparency, constantly setting goals and not meeting them, the (lack of a better word) lazy last 3 holiday events leave this game at what I would currently rank as 2 stars. Heck- I didn't event have to play the most recent event to get the rewards. Just signed in and was rewarded immediately. I loved this game. I miss the thrill of playing this game and having content that is engaging or fun for long time players. Even the newest large map fell flat to me as a consumer. And I've been around for a couple new maps, so I know what to expect when maps drop. I miss what this game was and what it originally promised. I hope that my opinion changes again for the better.

Now, all of them feel pitifully weak, because in addition to reworking the flashlights, the developers made the game even darker - so dark, in fact, that even at maximum brightness, if you don't know the map like the back of your bloody hand, you WILL get lost, and you can't see at all without a flashlight.\r\n\r\nGame is still alright if you have a group to play it with, if you can get past the shoddy lighting rework.

As changes made have reduced the horror element and from what I can tell it's become a streamer driven franchise. Example replacing the old spirit box which actually used to raise the hairs on the back of my neck to some recorded messages provided by streamers, which half the time you can't understand anyway. Then there's now the community seasonal events that look like poor skin jobs to existing locations, when we used to get a whole remodel or new map, this is when other games are bringing out random generated locations. Then there's the community event rather than being a bonus addition has replaced existing seasonal events. Any drive to do the seasonal missions is gone, as I'm sorry grinding out the same maps continually is not fun as 4 maps re-skinned seems like minimum effort and I'm sorry doesn't fill me with any personal satisfaction knowing that it's not a personal accomplishment, but dependency on enough of the community to do so, but I guess streamer content needs to be fuelled.

Ghosts get stuck on random furniture, teleport you for no reason during hunts, or just stop doing anything. Equipment like DOTS projectors either bug out or don’t even work, which makes the whole experience frustrating instead of spooky. How am I supposed to enjoy the game when half of it doesn’t function?\n\n[b]Seasonal Events Are a Joke[/b]\nWho thought it was a good idea to make events community-based instead of personal? Instead of teaming up with your friends and grinding for rewards, you’re just waiting around for the community to finish everything. It’s boring, lazy, and takes away any sense of achievement. Feels like a participation trophy at this point.\n\n[b]Dev Communication? Nonexistent.[/b]\nThe devs don’t even post updates here anymore unless they’re trying to sell you $50 plushies. The Christmas event? Never even got an announcement. If you’re not in their Discord, you won’t hear about anything. It’s like they’re purposely leaving the Steam community in the dark, which is just weird for a game this size.\n\n[b]Updates? Nah, Just Lazy Promises[/b]\nHorror 2.0 has been sitting on their Trello board since, like, 2021, and now it’s in the backlog. Meanwhile, the console release somehow went from “in progress” to “done” in less than a year. Priorities much? It feels like they’ve given up on making the game better and are just rushing out whatever they can to make more money.\n\n[b]Merch Over the Game? Seriously?[/b]\nInstead of fixing the game, they’re out here dropping overpriced merch and collectibles like we’re gonna eat that up. Newsflash: I’d rather play a working game than buy another plushie.\n\n[b]The Game Is Boring Now[/b]\nI’ll be for real... Phasmophobia used to be fun, but now it’s just the same thing over and over. The gameplay is stale, the bugs are annoying, and there’s nothing new to keep me hooked. It feels like the devs grabbed their money and dipped.\n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\nPhasmophobia had the chance to be something amazing, but the devs are dropping the ball big time.

The challenge modes and self induced handicaps extend the life of the game a tiny bit, but ultimately Phasmo is just too shallow of a game to enjoy long term.\n\nTo the dev's - It  may be wise to finish production of your game before releasing more merchandise. Sure, the merch probably doesn't take your attention away from development, but as a player, it sucks to see little trinkets for sale instead of completed features in a game I already paid for. Please breathe some life into this game - I'd love to see some character customization, maybe a skill tree or particular roles for investigation. I'd really appreciate a way to capture or banish the ghost instead of just figuring out that it's another Hantu and leaving the map. \n\nAlso - Please, PLEASE address the players run duration. A 5 second power-waddle around a kitchen island isn't fun for anyone.",bad

76561198026514712,"I mean... it's Phasmophobia - the game that popularized an entire genre of cooperative ghost hunting.\nUnfortunately, for over two years the game is plagued with developer decicions/priority making which ranges from poor to abysmal.\n\nTo get more into detail:\n* Bugs - the game is horribly buggy. This is not gernerally an issue per se as it is an early access game after all, but the developers don't seem interested in addressing even the most blatant bugs. For example: A few months ago they switched to new voice chat backend (Vivox). This however broke voice chat in the lobby (it works once you load into a map, but you'll pretty much always be kicked before due to you being unable to communicate) as well as voice recognition for many people. Rather than reverting to the previous voice chat backend (Phonon), the developers just ignored the problem, leaving the game in an essentially broken state for many players for months now. Even critical issues like this remain unaddressed when the fix would be as easy as just reverting a change. Also, many old bugs were never addressed, making this game feel like it falls more and more into disrepair with every update\n\n* Performance - falls into a similar category of the game accumulating more and more technical debt. Where you could easily run the 2020 version of the game on a low-end machine back then, these days you'll get occasional massive lags even on a mid- to high-end machine.\n\n* Lack of content - In the past (2020/2021) this game used to have an open beta where you could try out new or changed content. Updates on that branch would range from once a week to multiple times a day. While most of the updates were of course minor changes and fixes, you basically got a game mechanics improvement, changed ghost mechanics etc pretty much every other week. They listend to feedback to finetune these changes before pushing them to the release build every few months. Mid-2021 they stopped doing this open kind of development and in turn promised to release regular big updates as a kind of big content/mechanics drops and when the 0.3 update arrived a while after, it was a massive success. It overhauled lots of equipment, their effects, how they interact with ghost hunts, introduced a new evidence, changed the existing ghost evidences around, introduced new ghosts - overall just great. The next update 0.4 came not that long after and was the 2021 halloween update and was just as great, adding a new map, having some doors start open (so that coming across an open door no longer means ghost room) allowing ghosts to change rooms and adding a new difficulty, After that however, new content pretty much stalled. 0.5 would add cursed posessions which are fine, but for the most part just gimmicky things. 0.6 was just a VR overhaul which - in typical Phasmophobia fashion - broke VR completely for a good bunch of VR players - the issues remain unaddressed to this day.\nNow we're starting to get to the point where the game went into a very poor direction. Many people at the time were already complaining about the lack of meaningful content for the majority of people - especially with the long awaited ""Horror 2.0"" being delayed again and again (it's still not out by this day), so the developers promised a complete makeover of the Asylum map (which was the by far largest map at the time, but many rooms looked very similar). This then came in the 0.7 update in form of the Sunny Meadows map which shares nothing with the original Asylum map (other than both being an insane asylum), performs much worse and doesn't play very well with the game's mechanics. Many rooms still feel pretty much the same (even though usually more detailed). The tone also feels very off compared to the rest of the game. The rest of the locations may be creepy (such as the abandoned high school or prison), but were always just that and nothing more, never the big evil place where so many spooky things are happening. On Sunny Meadows you have screams in the hallways, rooms with the floor just covered in blood and human remains, rooms where the floor is covered with removed jaws, etc. They also removed the original Asylum map with that patch, preventing the players who liked it to play that map any longer. To the developer's credit: The 0.7 update also brought the 2021 halloween event which was the first and also most fun event they ever did. You had to play on nightmare mode on a few maps, collect all hidden candy which would then spawn pumpkins which you all had to light which would then cause the ghost to wear a pumpkin hat which you had to photograph. Do all of that and identify the ghost. Not too hard, but fun. The patch didn't introduce new game mechanics, it just took away a beloved map and replaced it with one that doesn't play well.\nNext was the ""player progression"" update which was the worst design decision made regarding this game. Rather than leveling up endlessly as previously, they reset everyone's level to 1 and once you reach level 100 you can press a button to reset your level back to 1, losing all unlocks in the process. I don't know how they ever thought that this would even remotely be a good idea. To the developer's credit: They announced these plans about a year in advance. Everyone hated it. They went through with it regardless and ignored all player feedback - everyone still hated it. No new actual game mechanics again. Even after these lackluster updates, there was no new ""major"" update until nearly a year later which only added a new lighthouse map which - surprise - doesn't play very well.\nWhich brings us to the 0.11 update which replaced the task-based seasonal events with community events where it's just ""photograph/use these randomly spawned things and/or complete the mission to contribute to a big score pool"", nothing else.\nIf you paid attention, you may have noticed that not much has changed for the positive since the addition of the cursed posessions about three years ago. The game has gotten stagnant. The developers have gotten too comfortable on the hype that was around it to the point that games which started out as just Phasmophobia clones like Ghost Exile these days offer a much more engaging and in-depth gameplay than Phasmophobia does and have surpassed their master \n\n* Ignoring the players\nNow this is highly subjective, but they used parts of the money and ressources they gained through Steam's early access program to port this game to consoles rather than using the ressources to overhaul things, add new mechanics, fix bugs, etc in the actual game to bring it closer to release. Nobody would have cared if this were already a fully released title, but with an early access title, there's the expectation that the money earned is used to actually finish the game rather than to swim on the hype train and also milk console players for their money. This gets even worse as the developers have completely stopped publishing changelogs for their patches through Steam (even though it would just be a copy-paste action for them), so if you want to see changelogs, you now have to go to their website. Their reason being that they just want one place for all players to view changelogs. Why they can't copypaste these into Steam like every other dev out there does is beyond me.\n",bad

76561198083681415,"As someone who's put in the hours and tried to adapt to Phasmophobia's quirks, I can't help but feel let down by the game's overall design and polish. Mastering the game is rewarding, but precisely after digging deeper, you'll find an [i]ultimately unrefined and often frustrating title that fails to live up to anything worthwhile.[/i]\n\nPhasmophobia feels like a prototype that never fully matured, or a demo stretched too thin. Many ghosts share similar patterns, and when they do try something unique—like the Wraith's teleportation or other specialized behaviors—most these mechanics end up feeling unfair or inconsistent rather than challenging. There's no satisfying sense of discovery, and the mechanical puzzle-solving is too shallow; it's mostly waiting, trial and error, with a lot of inconsistencies along the way if you're not using evidences.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nThe game's evidence system itself quickly feels shallow. Collecting clues is a mechanical routine rather than an engaging and dynamic process. You're essentially rotating through the same handful of tools — EMF readers, UV lights, spirit boxes — just waiting for something to happen, with very minor variations between them, such as switching to UV if you hear a door. Despite having numerous ghost types, most of them feel interchangeable in this regard, relying on the same handful of generic evidence items. There's little in the way of interesting traits or unique behavior patterns that would truly differentiate one ghost from another, even if you're playing no evidence contracts. All this leaves the game with a lack of gameplay depth or variety.\n\nHere's a concise example of poor design in Phasmophobia: every ghost has traits that can help identify them. This is particularly important in ""no evidence"" contracts, where (with one specific exception) evidence tools cannot be used to determine the ghost type. This is great! However, other than some traits being simply inconsistent or cumbersome to test, there are ghost traits that depend directly on timers, which the game doesn't provide you with at all. There is simply no in-game way to tell the passage of time, so you have to rely on external tools to keep track of ghost behavior: LiveSplit, a phone you can quickly juggle between, etc. This not only breaks immersion but also [b]throws a challenge that the player has no in-game tools to deal with[/b], unless you're good at counting up to 300 seconds in your head while multitasking 2-3 other things. You also can't customize the pool of ghosts, and neither the game nor its developers support or encourage modding. This could be solved by adding a stopwatch item to the game.\nI assure you, there are many more examples of bad design in Phasmophobia, such as limiting the number of photos you can take (also the tier 2 camera delay after taking them), but I'll leave it at that.\n\nBasic quality-of-life features are missing or badly implemented. There's no proper hotbar, so you're forced to juggle items with the scroll wheel, which is awful. Sprinting mechanics are clunky; 'toggle sprint' remains active even after your character depletes its extremely short stamina. Until very recently, joining private lobbies was needlessly complicated, using 6-digit codes (that's 1 million CONCURRENT lobbies — up to [i]4 million players connected in multiplayer![/i]) rather than taking advantage of Steam's API. It's baffling that a game so engaged with multiplayer makes such simple tasks feel so wearisome, with microphone levels resetting every time you enter a new lobby, etc.\n\nPhasmophobia's older maps, which constitute the majority, show very little effort in environmental storytelling. Sound design is mechanically poor, with transitions between exteriors and different floors being extremely noticeable. These shortcomings undermine what should be a core strength of a horror game: atmosphere.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nIn the end, Kinetic Games has failed in coming up with dynamic systems or combining the existing pieces into an orthogonal design, which would have made the game more engaging and replayable. The game's core loop is repetitive and lacks depth, and [b]the game's design often contradicts itself[/b], leading to a frustrating and unpolished experience. \n\nPhasmophobia is a game that can be fun to learn and play with friends, but that's generally despite its design, [i]not[/i] because of it.",bad

76561198065206414,"To start this review off, I have to give Phasmophobia credit and may explain my 78 hour playtime for a game I'm not recommending. In a lot of ways, I feel like it really kicked off this template of ghost hunting game. It was inventive, fun, and genuinely has (and still does) jump scare potential. That being said, it's apparent there are much better alternatives out there to play and almost all are better. I would only recommend picking up Phasmophobia on a deep discount in the same way I'd recommend checking out the original version of a game to see how far they've come.\r\n\r\nHere's a more detailed breakdown of what I think doesn't work:\r\n- Lot's of events but very few updates of substance like new levels, better ghost behavior etc...\r\n- You don't get a genuine sense of hunting or surprise from the ghost, it feels like it is on rails, either being too difficult or too easy\r\n- Not enough changes to ghost behavior, you've seen how it acts once, you've seen it all\r\n- Overly used environments, everything feels the same. I'd like to see the level progress with the hunt.\r\n- Developer reset original player progression to a new system and level locked the better version of tools instead of recognizing long time players. Hopping back in now feels slow and progress is punishing to get the better gear. I feel like they may think this is a hook, but it's prohibitive. \r\n- Again, leveling to getting better gear just is not fun. It's a grind without the dopamine of a grind",bad
76561198035102718,"First off, the premise is laughable. Ghosts? Really? I don’t need a proton pack or whatever gadget these ghost nerds use. If there were ghosts, they’d run screaming the moment I stepped into their haunted little house. But in this game, I’m expected to… what? Hide? Take blurry photos? Use some spirit box that sounds like static? That’s beneath me.\n\nAnd the equipment! Flashlights that flicker at the worst time, cameras that barely work what is this, amateur hour? Do you know who I am? I could laser through walls to find these so-called “spirits” in seconds. But no, this game insists I crawl around like some powerless human. It’s pathetic.\n\nAnd don’t get me started on the gameplay. You wander around dark houses or abandoned schools with your friends, looking for signs of ghosts. But most of the time, it’s just waiting for something to happen. I don’t wait. The idea of Homelander being vulnerable to a ghost hunt is downright insulting.\n\nThe “fear factor” everyone keeps raving about? Oh, please. I’m the most terrifying thing in any room. A ghost that can flicker lights or breathe on your neck isn’t going to faze someone like me. Honestly, it’s cute they think this is scary. You want scary? Try staring into my glowing red eyes when I’m pissed off. That’s terror.\n\nThe one thing this game does well is showing how helpless most people are. Watching others scream and scramble when the ghost attacks? Now that’s entertaining almost makes up for the mind-numbing gameplay.\n\nFinal verdict: Phasmophobia is a waste of time for anyone who’s already a god among men. But if you’re one of those weak, fragile humans who enjoys pretending to be brave, knock yourself out. Just don’t expect me to join your little ghost-hunting party.\n\nRating: 1/10. And that’s only because watching others flail around like idiots gave me a good laugh.",bad

This new item system just completely kills the pace in ways I can't begin to describe. It's so draining.\n\nAlso the UI just straight up sucks now, the original store UI was flat in presentation yeah but it was effective. The first store UI overhaul just looked like ass and was incredibly cumbersome to navigate and the current store UI is even worse. It really frustrates me to see things that weren't broken being ""fixed"", resulting in an infinitely worse state now. It's ""3 Lefts to Make a Right"": The Game. Every time I try to throw the current state of the game a bone I just find myself wiped out by the menu navigation and artificial limitations.\n\nRecent maps have been hit and miss. Some maps like the new (I say this despite it having come out a long while ago) Asylum being pretty decent, and a considerable improvement over the original Asylum, but then you have the Lighthouse map which is such a pain to navigate.\n\nI really hate to give DKnighter a lot of shit, but it just feels like him and his team's priorities are so fucking out of order. On God, what Phasmophobia has become is not too dissimilar to what the Star Wars Special Editions did to those movies. Playing this game in 2024 is just a draining experience to reach a the most basic level of enjoyment the game had in 2020. \n\nThe game still does really well if the Steam Charts are any indication, and that's cool, I am at least happy to see the game is  still successful, but I can't help but feel like players like me and my friends have been completely left in the dust.",bad

76561198112423303,"Phasmophobia is a game with a fantastic concept, but which somewhat fails to sufficiently execute the fantasy it is trying to sell you, primarily in the earlygame. Both for lack of unpredictable spooks, but also cause the core gameplay takes a long while to actually get engaging without frustration, and the learning curve is extremely steep. \n\nThe core gameplay loop is theoretically not reliant on you having all the items available, but having to play without items is simply not fun. Getting all the items requires a lot of cash. The cash starts coming in quicker once you get more items to guess the ghost better, but getting the cash in the first place is the issue, as you won't be able to guess the ghost consistently without the items. See the paradox this creates? You're essentially punished for simply starting the game, by instantly being put at a major disadvantage to the games intended core loop. Compare this to something like Lethal Company where you start out with all the tools you need (your 4 inventory slots and your scanner), and buying more items simply enhance your effectiveness. \n\nAnd this isn't even to mention how confusing Phasmophobia is for beginners. The tutorial NEEDS to be forced. There is no reality in where a game, wherein you are reliant on so many different abstract gadgets and trinkets to succeed, shouldn't be holding your hand for the first many hours. I have watched countless hours of content creators play the game, and put in 11 hours myself at time of writing, and I was STILL surprised to hear from a friend that the game has a tutorial. Because it's optional, and hidden away in some menu! It's flabbergasting. \n\nI know that the game starts getting really engaging and (subjectively) actually scary in the lategame, as you unlock massive locations, properly fitting of the games type of horror. However, the game starting you out in small suburban homes really does it a disservice. The ambient horror happening around you feels extremely scripted. The scares being limited to doors creaking open, lights flashing, noises in the dark, and eventually the ghost awkwardly waddling towards you while flashing like a poorly made GIF, just does not make for engaging horror. I've played enough Roblox to be able to recognize when an enemy is just pathing in a direct line towards you. It makes it feel synthetic. It reads more like a really low budget amateur horror movie, a piece of media not confident enough to be creative with their scares. \n\nI believe that Phasmophobia has a TON of potential to become a really properly scary co-op horror game. It gets points for being one of the very few co-op horror games on the market that actually takes itself seriously, and isn't just an amateurish college project. But I would not recommend it to someone who doesn't already have friends very experienced in it and willing to teach you the ropes, as the game, at time of writing, just doesn't seem interested enough in retaining new players.",bad

76561198084629376,"[h1] This is what happens when an indie dev doesn't listen to the community and applies favoritism [/h1]\n\nI started playing this game a few months after the release and i really loved it. But after hiring new staff it slowly became worse with each update, i'll list what are, in my opinion, the main issues with this game:\n\n[b] Balancement and grinding [/b] : More than an year ago the game got reset because of an update featuring tiered items, the problem with that was that you needed dozens of hours to basically go back to what you where already using before the update, and each update after that made the grinding for these items slower and slower, basically making the new player experience unbearable. At the same time it became a lot more difficult because they made the ghost abilities much more confusing and pushing for looping the ghost around tables instead of finding hiding spots or anyway trying to stay away from the ghost.\n\n[b] Community and content creators [/b] : Because of the grind most of the casual players were pushed away from the game, and the remaining part of the community became an elitist mess who discarded every type of criticism and just told to new players to ""get gud"" when they said something against the confusing gameplay loop or about the ghost abilities that did not praise the developers or the game. Meanwhile thanks to some youtubers and QA testers it was discovered that the developers themselves only listened to their close friends instead of the community as whole, they allowed some official content creators to abuse game bugs to have an advantage and reacted poorly to the criticism of each one who wasn't their friend.\n\n[b] Lack of updates and shortage of staff [/b] : The game sold a lot of copies but the main developer never hired more than 3-4 people because he said i wanted to keep his ""vision""of the game, the game though suffered a lot as a result because of the extremely long time between each content update, at the moment between the two newest content updates has passed more than 1 year and recently we only got a poor Halloween event and the console release that if they don't hire more stuff, will mean an even slower development of new content, as is said though, the main developer is too stubborn to hire new stuff and to listen to the part of the community that criticizes the game.\n\n\nAll things considered this game is on a collision course with a really sad ending, that it could only be prevented by developers and community listening to each other, but i don't have much hope that it will happen. \n\nI want to thank you if you read my review and i hope i helped you in deciding if you want to buy the game or not, i'll write a small TL:DR on the bottom.\n\n\nTL:DR: The game is not user friendly, requires a lot of grinding to get the best items and the developer don't listen to the community and make blatant favoritism.\n",bad

Some maps are just too big so it takes 15 minutes to find where the ghost is, which means you'll be spending 15 minutes just wandering around in the dark while nothing happens.\r\n\r\nIf you want an example of a well made investigation game look at Shadows of Doubt.\r\n\r\nI won't comment on the scare factor becase most games/movies generally don't scare me & this is not an exception, though i will say that the hunts feel very underwhelming & that i did not realize i was killed the first time i died, the animations are that bad.\r\n\r\nBesides the glaring game design problems, the game is technically quite bad: The game's physics runs at 60 Hz no matter the refresh rate of your screen, which would be fine if it had interpolation between frames, but alas it does not so the simple act of moving your character feels weird and jittery. This could easily be solved since the game is clearly made with Unity & other unity games do not suffer from this, but the abundance of store bought assets explains a lot.\r\n\r\nSmall nitpick: not being able to mess with your friends while dead really detracts form the ""party game"" vibe & makes being dead quite boring.",bad

Not a fan of giving money and time to a team that consistently fails on even the most basic assurances of professionalism to their fans and people who volunteer to test. (Look into hostile work environment, nude photo sharing and racist remarks in the dev discord by employees, CJ's fumbled and half-honest response posts on Reddit)\n\n2. The firm resistance against mods + lack of new content for the game.\nThe devs are firm in their stance against mods, even to the point of banning the topic of mods in the community discord. This has been in the name of ""protecting the vision"" of the game, which I could fully respect IF there was a meaningful amount of improvements and new content being added.\n\nThere's been ONE new map released in the last year, that's an unplayable labyrinth (The Lighthouse), and makes the round a chore to play. The events, such as the Blood Moon event, feel super lazy with minimal map changes that get old fast, and require hours of grind to see a, DRUMROLL, new player card background. \n\nThe store is a consistent mess and is honestly in it's best in it's current iteration, but is clunky and limited by its ALWAYS PRESENT first time hint UI. \n\nThe amount of money this games makes (revenue estimated in of hundreds of millions) and all there is to show is 13 maps, half-baked events, and coupled with gross behavior from the dev + QA team, I don't recommend this game.",bad
76561199543939344,"This game has unfortunately taken a massive turn for the worst. The Dev team sucks, they belittle their fan base, they don't allow modding or even speak of modding in their discord servers but continue to churn out half baked updates and events with no serious improvements. The new map release from months ago was so widely anticipated only for it to be the worst map in the game. The functionality of the lighthouse is so under-cooked it makes playing the map unbelievably frustrating and boring. This game originally hooked me on survival horror and gave me and my friends many of hours fun and much hope for the future of the game. But broken promise after broken promise with this game has led to nothing but disappointment and loss of hope for a game the entire community was rooting for. The Devs use teenage volunteers to play-test their game all the while they verbally abuse them and take none of their input seriously. They reflect this behavior to those who play and love their game the most, if it isn't their vision they won't listen, but they can't even update the game to make their vision be seen clearly by the community. I will no longer be playing this game or supporting the lowlife incels who run it.",bad

Devs don't put out any new maps or updates and when they eventually do, the updates are very half assed and lame. They do not support modding because they claim it takes away from the precious vision they have for this game, but their vision is dull and boring. Also unfortunately the devs are awful awful people, Just look up the drama involving them and the sexual harassment that takes place in their work environment. Devs are nothing but lazy good for nothing people, that walk all over anyone that has a different opinion than them. Im glad I got to make awesome memories with my friends but I'm very sad to let this game go due to how hardly anything has changed since release.",bad

It's no wonder the game still suffers from obvious bugs and issues. [b] Fire the abusers [/b]  Contrary to popular belief, these kinds of people do NOT belong in this industry.  Video-game devs try not to be worthless cunts challenge 2024 (impossible).  Multi-million dollar game btw.  \n\nEDIT:  They've dug their heels in and decided to keep the abusers.  DKnighter, hope your game rots.  Get a reality check.  Fucking 'tard.\n\nAlso their Discord mods are a bit embarrassing (but then again what Moderator isn't now-a-days?  Reddit, Discord etc.  Pretending their isn't a problem and silencing anyone that brings it up.  Very good look on their part.\n\n\n[i] In Phasmophobia you play as a ghost hunter with up to 3 other players (can be played solo offline if you want).  You pick your level, your difficulty and prepare what gear you want to bring in with you.  You enter, find the ghosts favourite room and proceed to use the tools and information available to you to deduce what kind of Ghost it is.  You can complete side objectives and take photographs for extra cash/xp.  There will also be a couple of powerful items within the level you may want to find and possibly make use of, much to the potential detriment of yourself.  Afterwards you leave, hoping you collected enough evidence to deduce the kind of ghost.  If you succeeded, you earn xp to level up and unlock higher tiers of equipment and money to buy said equipment and upgrades.\n\nWhile doing all of the above, the ghost will do what it can to lower your sanity, obfuscate it's behaviours and evidence and eventually try to kill you/your party.  These behaviours can vary depending on the kind of ghost.  Some can be more obvious than others.  Some, due to occasionally shitty RNG, really really hide their evidences.  If a player dies they continue on as a spirit with very little ability to help the remaining players.  You lose whatever items you brought, meaning you will have to spend money repurchasing those tools.  [/i]\n\nThe actual game is pretty fun, addictive even.  The puzzle aspect is enjoyable once you start reducing the evidence the ghost can give out.  It makes it so you have to intentionally get it to Hunt to gather extra information you wouldn't normally look for.  Granted, that kind of info is fairly hard to learn without looking stuff up.  It's fairly chill with the occasional ""Oh Shit!"" moment. \n\nThere are multiple difficulties you can even customise your own difficulty with varying parameters and earn less or more XP/Cash depending on the modifiers.\n\nThe game is very unwelcoming to new players.  Information in-game is fairly obtuse.  The grind is also abysmal.  The starting player tools are genuinely awful and it wouldn't surprise me if most noobs quit after their first few games.\n\nIt still lacks some fairly basic features like a HUD that tells you the equipment you are carrying, how much of it you have left to use etc.  Not even 1,2,3,4 key-binds for your items??  Scroll and Q are clunky to use.  You get used to it but it could be so much better.  Hell what about a inventory wheel like a lot of FPS games have been doing lately?\n\nIt is comprised mostly of Unity Store Assets, but they are used very well and cohesively.  On one hand, I personally feel these need to be removed and updated to original in-house stuff. \n Otherwise it's just sheer laziness at this point.  Speaking of which though nothing has ever really felt out of place except for the player character models themselves which as I understand are due to be changed fairly soon if there road-map is to even be believed at this point given their history lmfao.\n\nAlso, dev is against mods because ""they go against their artistic vision.""  Saying that about an asset flip is daring.\n\nFTR; I've played this roughly since EA release on Steam.  It's a lot better than it was but still feels like a Minimum Viable Product.  I understand it had a solo dev for a while who then eventually started hiring, so of course progress is slow.\n\nUntil they sort out the issues at the very start of this review, I'm keeping this negative.

76561198298046100,"I'm sure that at some point the game used to be good, but at this point in time, the game is not satisfying. From the beginning, all the shop and inventory menus are laid out in a way that comes across as cluttered and overstimulating, like a chore to work through. While it gives you a tutorial from the start on how to work these menus, I feel they shouldn't be cluttered enough to need a tutorial to begin with. In terms of gameplay, it's similar to that of a real life ""ghost hunt,"" however with problems. Sure, you can investigate and collect evidence toward discovering the identity of the ghost in question, but in the end you're never going to pin down the correct entity. It doesn't matter what evidence you gather or what ghosts you see on your screen, the game will actively ignore all of this, rarely give you checkmarks, and make up an entity that disregards all prior evidence. Speaking of the ghosts, it's not likely you'll even encounter it to begin with. The bigger the map gets, the more your game time will consist of wandering the building with your limited set of tools, hoping something bites, and once it does you're already dead anyway. Worst of all, it's just not scary. The animation and art style tries to be realistic, funny, and scary at the same time but just comes off as unpolished; it feels like it doesn't know what it wants to be.

76561198045946472,"Don't get me wrong, this game IS fun and an adrenaline rush. It can absolutely get spooky with its jump scares and the anxiety of knowing the ghost could literally hunt you at anytime is nail biting at times. It is a fun game to play with friends or solo and there is a significant learning curve to how each individual ghost works.\r\n\r\nBUT\r\n\r\nIt is a very grindy and relatively pointless adventure. For those looking at this game for the first time, you are a ghost ""Identifier"". You are given a good handful of locations to go to which can range from a single story house to a long abandoned and maze like asylum. Once you arrive at your selected location, you will always have the same main objective- gather 3 pieces of evidence  with various items, identify the ghost, get out. You are always provided with 3 additional objectives to earn extra money, however at the start, you may not be able to do these objectives. \r\n\r\nAs you progress, and unlock more/ better items, you are able to use them to identify ghosts easier...sometimes. You are also given other items that can help with survival, hunts, completing secondary objectives, and help narrow down the identification of a ghost without needing evidence.....sometimes. \r\n\r\nThat's more or less the entire game. You're never given a reason why you're doing these investigations, nor is there ever any kind of story that explains things as you continue.  Your only form of progress is unlocking items and gaining knowledge on ghosts as you learn general behaviors. If you're an achievement hunter or someone who likes to 100% games, then enjoy endless repetition of  finding the room the ghost is in, gathering information while completing objectives, and then leaving. \r\n\r\nThis is a very watered down description of what you will be doing. Obviously there is more challenge and randomization in how each ghost works, but once you've completed one investigation, you've basically done 80% of what the game has to offer you. \r\n\r\nMy experience with the game ranges from solo to being the brave one to complete things while someone watches from the van to being part of a pretty decent investigation team. I've been playing this game off and on for about 2 years and I can say with a strong level of certainty that I can only play 1-4 investigations before I'm so bored that I would rather do anything else. I will play the game when it updates, check out the new things, then shelf it until the next update rolls around. I can't stomach it for longer, especially when the ghost is being extremely difficult or there is some kind of bug that absolutely obliterates my interest. \r\n\r\nAt the time of writing this review, the game launched its 2024 Halloween event. In the past, holiday events were themed Easter Egg hunts and a string of little challenges that ultimately unlocked some minor cosmetic change and a little trophy. It was cute and fun for a couple of days and often brought me back for a little longer just so I could enjoy the vibes that each map brought.\r\n\r\nHowever with this event, the devs decided to make the reward progress tied to the entire community's progress. I will say that the decoration of the maps is absolutely spot on and does indeed give the chosen maps a nice and refreshing glow up. But in place of the cute Easter Egg hunt and simple puzzles, you are tasked with taking pictures of these small monolith like structures that appear in random locations on the designated maps and in random amounts. Once you do that, you go about the investigation like normal, though this time the ghost is extremely active and extremely aggressive. \r\n\r\nThis is a welcome challenge...until you see how little progress is made in the community's reward progress. Each reward is tracked by percentage and there are 3 rewards. The community has until November 13th to do as much as they can to try and get all 3 rewards. It's been 24 hours since the launch of the event and the community has managed to complete under 1.5% of the first reward. If you are halfway decent at math, then you'll know that in 15 days and at the same percentage increase per day, then you'll see that its not enough progress to get even half way through the first reward's progress bar, let alone all 3. \r\n\r\nAdd in that the game's means to progress this bar has very little change in terms of overall game play AND is actively harder for everyone, including new players, and it just makes the game (for me) even more frustrating and tedious to play. There also isn't even a requirement for participation, you can be someone who can just come in at the end of the event's run and collect whatever rewards have been unlocked, and then dip. \r\n\r\nSo with all that said:\r\n\r\nThe game is extremely repetetive.\r\nThe game is grindy.\r\nThe game is challenging, but sometimes not in a good way due to ghost RNG or bugs.\r\nThe game  is often poorly balanced in what it asks players to do to get achievements and fun little rewards to keep players intrigued.\r\n\r\nAnd the big one for me\r\n\r\nOther than a new map, new ghost type, new equipment, and a few quality of life changes here and there (some good, some bad), there is very little that has changed about this game in 2 years since I have been playing it and even in its 1.0 state, the amount of unappealing (looking at you player models) , grindy, and buggy things allowed to still be in this game is absolutely baffeling",bad
76561198099029666,"The game is still fun with friends. Buy it on sale. It just isn't what it was on launch and Im not cool with that but I can't say the changes were the worst.\n\nThe game was a fun horror 'party' game to play with friends when it came out. You could give yourself money, buy the limited equipment choice, and just have a good time with friends. That being said there wasn't much progress to make within the game. No cosmetics to unlock, gear to unlock, or maps to unlock. Everything was kinda just given to you. They eventually added actual progression which is cool and all but they also reset everyone. So everyone returning to the game had no levels, no money, and started with the new basic tier of equipment. This immediately killed the game for me. Getting demoted from a temp gun to a literal mercury thermometer is INSANE punishment for buying this game. They also keep releasing huge maps. The amount of time I've wasted walking around the school just waiting for the red line to drop in the thermometer isn't quantifiable. \n\nThere's other red flags such as: 4 years of early access, an aggressive EULA, and they'll ban you for using any sort of mods, cosmetic or otherwise.\n\nOverall the game was amazing and if you buy it today you might think it is with their new changes. I however, miss the casual gameplay loop.",bad
76561198072839235,"This review breaks my heart. I have over 150 hours in the game. The most recent ten hours was because i tried the newest updated version and got immediately deflated when all the items and progression was ripped out under me. I figured ti was just unpolished and needed more time to fix itself. I came back and found it even more of a mess. I have a new plack on the wall that has my lvl 595 on it but besides that the game has stuck me with under performing equipment expecting me to grind out for a while to get back to the fun i originally had with game. Game Camera's bug out now leaving me without the ability to check for orbs or dots as the screen in the van is frozen whenever I try to interact with it. Everything is way more complicated with load outs. Its like they tried to fix a working system by making it over the top complicated. I am super devastated that this game has gotten to this. I am amazed it still has overwhelmingly positive reviews.  It used to be my go to casual horror fun with randoms and friends. I do not want to play this anymore, it feels like a chore to get it to perform at all and I no longer can recognize it from what it once was. Please bring my casual ghost adventures horror back.

It gets boring after the 50th hour and has little to no proper major updates that can hold anyone's attention span for longer than an hour or two. The game's biggest flaw is that it has no updates that add any substance or change gameplay in anyway.

There has nothing substantial added to the game in years and that's its most disappointing aspect. \r\n\r\nAnother thing is that it's horror factor is just simply on the lower end if you aren't on VR.

Instead they have now made the decision to lock the tool that allows people to create fun challenges for themselves and their friends behind level 50 which takes potentially 10-20 hours before you are allowed to play the way you want.\n\nTop that off with the devs now abandoning the tools Steam provides them to talk to their community in favor for their own website after attempting to force people onto their discord for years prior.

The avatars are still using Unity asset store models, the game is quite poorly optimised considering its visuals, and the main gameplay loop leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nThe current main goal of the game is simply to get money, nothing else. You complete an investigation, complete quests, and then get money that lets you buy items to make each investigation easier. The more you play the game, the easier it gets, which feels entirely backwards. Worse yet, you lose your hard earned items upon failing an investigation. You now need money again, and essentially have to farm multiple easier investigations for a single shot at a harder one. Genuinely think the game would be a lot better if there was any other reason to earn money than simply better gear.\n\nIt absolutely does not help that the shop menu is completely abysmal. I genuinely cannot for the life of me understand how it works. It was quite bad previously, but it's even worse now, and there doesn't seem to be any signs of it changing anytime soon.

There's tiered versions of the items which really restricts the gameplay since you won't just fail by not finding the evidence, you simply won't find the evidence because the early versions of the items suck, which also makes levelling up incredibly slow since you need to win to get sufficient XP.

76561198069055117,"Even on intermediate, the ghost will take FOREVER to give you one of the pieces of evidence. It'll take AGES with the beginning equipment and 10 times out of 10 you'll die before you can even find it. Its super irritating, and really boring to wave an EMF reader around and it teasing you with ""OOO ITS 4 BUT YOU WONT GET 5"" Or the edging with the thermometer. I'm tired of it. Solid ""Meh"" :P\n\nI honestly feel like a hunt killing you right off the bat is not great. I think if a ghost catches you during a hunt it should significantly lower your sanity rather than killing you right off the bat, only killing you when you reach 0. It just feels like everytime I start getting into the spook of the game I die and its in a really corny non-immersive jarring manner. I don't think I've heard once of a ghost (irl) reaching around behind you like a peek-a-boo doll and going ""GUESS WHO"" to kill you. I just feel the game needs a lot of refinement around the hunts to give more of a spook factor rather than ""how fast can you wait"".\n\nThe Mimic is a good idea, isn't very good execution. Rather than only mimicing ghost orbs, it should have a passive that picks a random piece of evidence to mimic. It would make it more engaging rather than everytime you see ghost orbs you groan. I absolutely loathe it when I think I have all the evidence I need only for the screen to go ""Nah fam, its a mimic, you didn't sit there for 5 more minutes asking words into a box in the dark.""\n\nI understand not having a lot of sprint on small maps to balance it out, but on the big maps it is just pain. It makes me not want to play any of the amazing hand crafted maps you guys have because they're just too big to enjoy. Are our characters 500 pounds? Have they never ran anywhere their entire lives? Its just a bit.... Lame.\n\nOther than those gripes, a very okay game to play. Its nice to relax to after coming home from work, and can be fun at times. Just not the most immersive or amazing ghost hunting game on the planet. Mods and modded lobbies would benefit this game tenfold.\n\nThe spirit box is wholey unreliable no matter what ""tier"" it is. You absolutely need to make the ghost talk more often on the damned thing. You get instant every other piece of evidence but when it comes to the spirit box you're just sitting there repeating yourself over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. Its not fun, either give it some more trigger phrases or make the ghost talk more often. If the spirit box is fixed the review would be positive. I mean, Spirit box is literally the first thing every single ghost hunt youtuber, show writer, and kook uses to ""prove"" ghosts are real and its the most reliable way of doing so, why isn't this in the game as well?",bad

76561199287937724,"Having invested over 80 hours into Phasmophobia, I can confidently say the game is full of potential that sadly remains untapped. While it initially captures your attention with its creepy atmosphere and unique co-op gameplay, it quickly becomes stale due to a variety of frustrating issues. First and foremost, the progression system feels non-existent. Once you’ve played a handful of rounds, you've essentially seen everything. The ghost types, while varied on paper, often behave in similar ways, making each hunt feel repetitive. There’s little to no sense of advancement, and unlocking equipment doesn’t provide the satisfaction or depth you would expect from a game in this genre.\nThe AI, which is central to the fear factor, is inconsistent at best and laughably predictable at worst. Ghosts often glitch, get stuck in certain areas, or become easy to manipulate, removing any real tension from hunts. And for a game that thrives on suspense, that’s a huge letdown. Multiplayer, while fun with friends, quickly becomes a chore when faced with technical issues. Lag, disconnections, and server instability plague the experience, and playing with random players is hit-or-miss due to lack of moderation or proper matchmaking. The development team has been slow with meaningful updates, and while new maps or ghost types are welcome, they don’t fix the core issues of gameplay repetition and technical shortcomings. The game feels more like an Early Access title than a finished product, even after all this time. \nIn conclusion, Phasmophobia had the makings of a horror gem, but the developers seem content with its barebones structure. Unless major improvements are made, it’s hard to recommend for anyone beyond casual co-op horror fans looking for a short thrill.\n\nRating: 4/10",bad

It's like going into a game that expects you to know everything about it :(((((",bad

76561198292838309,"Trailer looks great and makes you want to buy and play this game. It’s interesting at first but ultimately is very slow and repetitive. I don’t recommend this game for anyone who isn’t willing to play in 4 player mode because that’s where it gets more fun, with others..   otherwise this game got boring real quick.",bad
76561198155498313,"This game is absolute garbage. I have no idea why people are so hyped about this. Mechanics are crappy, graphics are crappy, there is no suspense it is in fact not scary at all. One of the lamest titles I ever played.",bad
76561198138860368,"Firstly, this is Still a good game to play with friends if you want something to do while you chat. It's casual but engaging, and talking about normal things through the in game mic adds a Lot to the game in my opinion. I Really liked this game in early access honestly, and I don't think my critique is enough to warn you away from the game entirely.\n\nHowever, some of the changes they've rolled out post full release bother me to the point I don't think I can recommend it. Namely, the terrible starting equipment. the default equipment from before tiers was Good, I got used to how to use it and had a decent success rate. Now, it's a struggle to get all pieces of evidence and a lot of the time me and my friends wind up Guessing based on what we do have wither after we all get hunted and have one person left or we simply have sunk too much time in to one map. Honestly, I'd even be fine if Early Access accounts had the old default tier unlocked. It's the abrupt down grade of equipment that infuriates me.",bad

76561198115110701,"I've played Phasmophobia on and off since about 2019 (when there was about 9 ghosts) and only took a handful of hours to play which is why my hours are so low.\n\nThe game itself is very unique and, while not story driven, very fun to play within Multiplayer or when streaming with a live chat especially! Not one I'd personally play solo without some kind of chat, as it can get very repetitive. However if you find that style of game fun to play solo, absolutely take a spin.\n\nThe biggest problem I've encountered coming back to this game is just how many ghosts there are. While originally there were 9 ghosts, they were all distinct enough that it was possible to start getting haunts correctly identified once you got used to everything, especially with how big the maps sometimes are. While having a large amount of content (especially for long time players) is fantastic for replay ability, due to how overwhelming the amount of ghosts are with the small amount/ineffective equipment you get when you are playing at low level, it is such a steep learning curve that it becomes hard to enjoy even when you're with friends.\n\nI truly wish that the amateur level had less ghosts so it was easier for new players to get into (or relearn after a long time of not playing) or that there was a way to turn off certain ghosts to make it a more fun experience for casual players. \n\nAs much as I enjoy this game, I truly would not recommend this game for casual/new players unless you're willing and able to learn just about every ghost and top player technique until there is a way to properly ease into the game and the amount of work you have to do to discern against different ghosts. Hopefully the devs will take into account new/returning players in the future.",bad
76561198125561203,Was fun until recently. Now I just get kicked every other game. Unplayable. Thanks. Good luck with your console release when you can't even handle a 2-player session on the same network. Get rekt,bad
76561198311799895,"Most boring game i ever started, even tho i really am late to the game.\nYou run around for 10 minutes, trashing rooms and not knowing what to do, then you die with kinda ridiculous animations... seriously, this is kinda pathetic, compared to games like lethal company..\nNot scary, not fun, kinda boring even with friends and not randoms",bad
76561198029822571,"Fix the camera properly, adding a delay stuffs up the ability to snap and smudge due to the fact you need to wait for the camera once you've taken the photo. It's amazing how far the devs have gone  by using untested fixes that break other systems unintentionally. Sloppy programming as far as I'm concerned.",bad

76561198022277055,"I've had a lot of fun with the game over the years.

76561198059356960,I would give a 9/10 but it keeps crashing when I end a game and I gain no XP. If I would gain the XP I would not mind that much to just rejoin the lobby. I SIMPLY CAN'T PROGRESS since you need to lvl up to unlock better equipements and win in harder haunted zones.\r\n\r\nMy computer is not that old. (it can easily play games like Diablo IV with high graphics settings and I tried lowering settings for this game). I tried many solutions proposed online but it was in vain. \r\n\r\nI paid for this game I should not have to work that hard to make a game function. 2/10.\r\nI see that this problem is pretty common and not new so I would not recommend buying this game.,bad

76561198067920389,"What can i say about this game... it's only really ""fun"" if you manage to get a group of 4 friends together. and even then i find myself getting bored. this game released back in 2020 and after 4 long years there is still only 1 death animation, the one where hands come onto your screen and then you are inside a room with the ghost and the light bulb pops... seriously? after 4 years you guys couldn't add more death animations?\n\ni might not have a lot of hours in this game, but that's because it's just not fun. they added an anti-cheat into this game but.. why? you only really play this game with friends, as playing with randoms is a dumb idea since they either troll, or don't do anything. you might find the odd ones who help. but with how annoying the grind is, I've seen people use cheats and hacks just to mod themselves to the max level and get a LOT of money just to be able to use the good equipment, and i do not blame them for it.\n\nthe weird part is, ive rarely played this game, yet i log in and get an achivement for being prestige 1? how? what?? makes no sense to me.",bad

76561198215583548,"Scary--scary bad.  \nI played this game often with friends when it was early in development and it was a lot of fun.  More recent updates made it less fun and my friend group dropped the game for a while.  We picked it back up after a year and yikes, yikes, yikes.  It was unplayable.  My friend tried playing in VR and the game kept crashing till they quit VR mode.  When we started investigating, my character got stuck and I was unable to move or reset myself and ultimately forced to drop the match.  Between the buggy game play and the crappy updates that min-level blocked a lot of the equipment we used to play with, it's just not a fun game to play anymore.  We won't be playing again.",bad
76561198272325284,This game is no longer as fun as it used to be nor is it that user friendly. Call me a boomer or what ever but I've played this game over the years and it feels more and more foreign with every update. Not to mention the new leveling system locking equipment and maps that I had access to for essentially forever before the update. Now if I want to use those equipment or play those maps I have to grind just to be able to do so again.,bad

Ever since the update where they changed the look of all the equipment and the main hub section it's basically impossible to identify ghosts. Even on the lowest difficulty the game will give you false positives or just flat out not give you any indicators, leaving you to guess the answer. And you'll most likely guess wrong because of said lack of activity.\n\nI used to recommend this game, but since it's been the way it is for years now I doubt it'll be in a playable state again.
